This new collection of fantastic, lesser-known one-acts contains some of Williams’s most potent, witty and wild late plays written from 1971 to 1982―Upper East Side ladies dine out during the apocalypse in _Now the Cats With Jeweled Claws_; a pair of nonagenarians struggle to cope on the Queen Elizabeth II in _Lifeboat Drill_; the poet Hart Crane makes peace with his mother at the bottom of the ocean in _Steps Must Be Gentle_; and madness bewitches the occupants during a nursing home strike in _This Is the Peaceable Kingdom_. Previously unpublished late plays include _Aimez-Vous Ionesco?_, a parody of the Theater of the Absurd; _A Recluse and His Guest_, a fable about a traveling woman in a dark world who can only go forward, never back; and _Ivan’s Widow_, in which a psychiatrist and his young female patient engage in sexual power play that leads to murder.
