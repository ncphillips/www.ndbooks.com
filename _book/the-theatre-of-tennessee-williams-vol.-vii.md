The _Theatre of Tennessee Williams_ brings together in matching format the plays of one of America’s most persistently influential and innovative dramatists. Arranged in chronological order, this ongoing series includes the original cast listings and production notes for all full-length plays. Now available as a New Directions paperbook, _Volume VII: In the Bar of a Tokyo Hotel and Other Plays_, contains Williams’s shorter plays of the late ’50s and ’60s, many of them published in _Dragon Country_ in 1970. In "dragon country... this country of endured but unendurable pain," the bar, the hotel lobby, the boarding house, the nursing home or "retirement village" are microcosms of the human condition where we are never, but always, alone. To the plays of _Dragon Country_ are added _Now the Cats with Jewelled Claws_, _Lifeboat Drill_, and _This Is the Peaceable Kingdom_. This is an essential collection for all students and fans of the great playwright.
