_A Hermit's Guide to Home Economics_ combines three long poems Robert Lax composed on the Island of Patmos, where he lived apart from the world. Lax writes humorously about his "hermit" life, as if he were King Solomon doing a stand-up routine. But he also writes like a mystic whose surroundings speak to him, and he uses the whole field of the page to explore the full potential of the word as image and the poet as citizen.

_I just won't talk. I won't let on that I see what goes on in the world._
