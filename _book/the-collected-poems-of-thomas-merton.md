In 1944, New Directions brought out Thomas Merton’s first book of verse. By the time of his tragic, untimely death in 1968, Father Louis (as he was known at the Trappist monastery where he lived for twenty-seven years) had published upwards of fifty books and pamphlets, including several more collections of poetry. All of these poems have been assembled in a single, definitive volume (first published by New Directions in 1977) which includes much additional unpublished or uncollected material drawn from the archive of the Merton Studies Center at Bellarmine College in Louisville, Kentucky, or supplied by the poet’s friends and associates. Brought together in _The Collected Poems of Thomas Merton_ are: _Early Poems_ (1940-42, published posthumously in 1971), _Thirty Poems_ (1944), _A Man in the Divided Sea_ (1946), _Figures for an Apocalypse_ (1947), _The Tear of the Blind Lions_ (1949), _The Strange Islands_ (1957), _Original Child Bomb_ (1962), _Emblems of a Season of Fun_ (1963), _Cables to Ace_ (1968), and _The Geography of Lograire_ (completed in 1968 and published posthumously). These are followed by _Sensation Time at the Home and Other New Poems_, a book which Merton completed shortly before his death. There are also sections of uncollected poems, humorous verse, poems written in French, with some English translations, Merton’s translations of poetry from various languages, drafts and fragments, and a selection of concrete poems. With the availability of _The Collected Poems of Thomas Merton_ as a New Directions paperbook, an ever wider audience may more fully appreciate the impressive range of the poet’s technique, the scope of his concerns, and the humaneness of his vision.
