Drawing on six decades of her writing life, this _Selected Poems_ offers a chronological overview of Denise Levertov’s great body of work. Here at last is a clear, unobstructed view of her groundbreaking poetry — the work of a poet who, as Kenneth Rexroth put it, "more than anyone, led the redirection of American poetry ... to the mainstream of world literature."
