_Because She Never Asked_ is a story reminiscent of that reached by the travelers in Patricia Highsmith's _Stranger on a Train._ The author shall write a piece for the artist Sophie Calle to live out: a young, aspiring French artist travels to Lisbon and the Azores in pursuit of an older artist whose work she's in love with. The second part of the story tells what happens between the author and Calle. She eludes him; he becomes blocked and suffers physical collapse.

"Something strange happened along the way," Vila-Matas wrote. "Normally, writers try to pass off a work fiction as being real. But in _Because She Never Asked_, the opposite occurred: in order to give meaning to the story of my life, I found that I needed to present it as fiction."
