The rich corpus of Classical Arabic literature, encompassing poetry, history, science, and theology, is only beginning to be translated into English. What special obstacles do these texts pose for translators, and how might they speak to contemporary concerns with comparative philology, secular traditions within Islam, and the specter of untranslatability? Shihab al-Din al-Nuwayri’s 14th-century encyclopedia, The Ultimate Ambition in the Arts of Erudition, is a compendium of historical knowledge, literary craft, and scientific lore.

      One of the most popular and enigmatic American writers of the nineteenth century, Emily Dickinson (1830–1886) wrote almost 1,800 poems. Nevertheless, her work was essentially unknown to contemporary readers since only a handful of poems were published during her lifetime and a vast trove of her manuscripts was not discovered until after her death in 1886.
Often typecast as a recluse who rarely left her Amherst home, Dickinson was, in fact, socially active as a young woman and maintained a broad network of friends and correspondents even as she grew older and retreated into seclusion.

      Scarred Hearts: New York Premiere
 141 m. Radu Jude.Romania/Germany. Romanian with subtitles. NR.  Romania, 1937. A young man spends his days at a sanatorium on the Black Sea coast, suffering from bone tuberculosis. Falling in love with another patient, he narrates their attempts to live life to the fullest as their bodies slowly fade away but their minds refuse to give up. This refreshingly unconventional drama is loosely based on Jewish Romanian author Max Blecher’s autobiographical novel Scarred Hearts, written before he died at age 29, after ten years of suffering.

To mark its centennial, Turner Prize winner Simon Starling reinterprets this production in an exhibition that illustrates the impact of noh on Western Modernism. Newly created masks, costumes, and a dance on video are paired with works by the 20th-century masters connected to Yeats&rsquo; play, bringing to life Starling&rsquo;s irrepressible inventiveness.

      Deutsches Haus at NYU presents a reading by Reiner Stach from his recent nonfiction book Is that Kafka? 99 Finds, followed by a conversation between the author and the acclaimed translator of the book, Kurt Beals.
In the course of compiling his highly acclaimed three-volume biography of Kafka, while foraying to libraries and archives from Prague to Israel, Reiner Stach made one astounding discovery after another: unexpected photographs, inconsistencies in handwritten texts, excerpts from letters, and testimonies from Kafka&rsquo;s contemporaries that shed surprising light on his personality and his writing.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      One of the undisputed intellectual giants of postwar Germany, Alexander Kluge is a writer, theorist, filmmaker, and television pioneer with a prolific career spanning almost six decades. His reputation in the US, however, is still narrowly associated with the 1962 Oberhausen Manifesto calling for a “new German film,” as well as with his acclaimed films of the 1970s. This fall, the Goethe-Institut, Anthology Film Archives, and the Museum of Modern Art honor Kluge’s interdisciplinary oeuvre in its varied expressions, introducing selected works for the first time to local audiences as well as revisiting with him some of the beloved older ones.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      When Anthology Film Archives opened its doors at 32 Second Avenue in 1988, the first series they presented was an Alexander Kluge retrospective. A central figure in the formation of the New German Cinema, a student of Theodor Adorno, and author across several media, Kluge is one of the most vital postwar European artists. He also remains one of the most active, even if his latter-day work is largely unknown on this side of the Atlantic.

      Fifty years on, Alexander Kluge is best known as a leading figure of the New German Cinema, born of the 1962 Oberhausen Manifesto. Yet his seminal filmmaking of the 1960s and 1970s is paralleled by his subsequent work as a writer, theorist, and film and television director. Publications pairing Kluge’s writing with the photography of Gerhard Richter, a collaboration with artist duo DAS INSTITUT (Kerstin Brätsch and Adele Röder), and boundary-pushing television productions all testify to the genre-defying vision of a true pioneer.

In performance, Gozo Yoshimasu’s language is incantatory and strange. He breaks down Japanese into phonemes, counterpointed sonic progressions, and rhymes. Often, he’ll include fragments of English, French, Chinese, Okinawan or Korean and, on paper, he uses multiple scripts—romanji, Korean hungul, and invented man’yo-gana and pictographs as well as normal Japanese kanji, hiragana, and katakana.

Starting with the Greek writings of Hippocrates and the Latin language of medicine, and drawing from Leonardo da Vinci’s Anatomical Manuscripts, the dermatologist Robert Willan’s On Cutaneous Diseases (1808), and Baudelaire’s The Flowers of Evil, Legris infuses each poem with unique rhythms that roll off the tongue.

      Alvin Lustig and Elaine Lustig Cohen are towering figures in American graphic design. Lustig, a beloved teacher and influential critic as well as a polymath designer, advocated an ambitious mission for the discipline, insisting that a true designer could guide public taste toward “the proper expression of the society he lives in.” As head of her own office, Cohen maintained an independence that was rare for women at mid-century. In 1973 she co-founded Ex Libris, a rare book and ephemera shop that played an essential role in the development of design history.

      Ignoring verisimilitude is one of the ways to tear down the division between fiction and reality. César Aira tells stories, sometimes with many realist overtones, but he always upsets the plausible and avoids incidental elements to set his story. The Argentine author will discuss his most recent English publication, The Musical Brain and Other Stories, with Sergio Chejfec, inviting us to that peculiar universe which proves that in life there are events that cannot be explained by Western Rationalism.

His new book The Musical Brain &amp; Other Stories is the first collection of his stories to appear in English, and comprises twenty tales about oddballs, freaks, and crazies. Aira gives readers imponderables to ponder and bizarre and seemingly out-of-context plot lines to consider, as well as thoughtful and passionate takes on everyday reality.
