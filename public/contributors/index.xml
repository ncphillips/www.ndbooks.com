      <description>Wang An-shih (1021–1086) was a remarkable figure—not only one of the great Song Dynasty poets but also the most influential and controversial statesman of his time. Wang rose to the position of Prime Minister, where he instituted a controversial system of radically egalitarian social reforms in an effort to improve the lives of China’s peasants. Wang then left politics and retired to a reclusive artistic and spiritual life of self-cultivation. Wang spent those later years practicing Ch’an (Zen) Buddhism and wandering the mountains around his home, and that Taoist civilization of the rivers-and-mountains realm shapes his poems.</description>

      <description>A poet, writer, and artist, Ferreira Gullar (b. 1930), the pen name of José Ribamar Ferreira, is the central figure of the Brazilian poetry movement the Neo-Concretes. Exiled by the Brazilian government from 1964 to 1985, Gullar worried that he’d meet the gruesome fate of so many other exiled writers and this fear inspired him to write his best-known work, Poema Sujo, or Dirty Poem. The poem spans one hundred pages and was written to be a sort of last will and testament.</description>

      <description>From &amp;ldquo;The Book Jackets of Alvin Lustig&amp;rdquo; by James Laughlin, Print Magazine, Oct/Nov 1956
 The first jacket which Lustig did for a New Directions Book — the one for the 1941 edition of _Henry Miller’s Wisdom of the Heart —_ was quite unlike anything then in vogue, but it scarcely hinted at the extraordinary flowering which was to follow. It was rather stiff and severe - a non-representational construction made from little pieces of type metal chosen from the cases in the experimental printing shop he had set up in the hinter regions of a drugstore in Brentwood.</description>

      <description>One of the most significant contributors to twentieth-century Argentine poetry, Alejandra Pizarnik made a name for herself through her dark themes and diction. Heavily influenced by Rimbaud and Artaud, Pizarnik believed that suffering was intrinsic to the creation of great poetry. This concession to misery was apparent in her work as her writing was often filled with themes of solitude, estrangement, madness, and death—yet also included moments of tenderness. During her short lifetime she wrote seven books of poetry and one book of prose, as well as numerous translations, short stories, essays, and drawings.</description>

      <description>Nikolai Gogol (1809–1852) was a novelist and political satirist. Born in Sorochintsi, Ukraine, he grew up on his parents’ country estate. In 1828 Gogol, an aspiring writer, settled in St. Petersburg, with a certificate attesting his right to “the rank of the 14th class.” To support himself Gogol worked minor governmental jobs and wrote occasionally for periodicals. Although he was interested in literature, he also dreamed of becoming an actor. However, the capital of Russia did not welcome him with open arms and his early narrative poem, Hans Küchelgarten (1829), turned out to be a disaster.</description>

      <description>William Carlos Williams (1883–1963) was a poet, short-story writer, novelist and essayist whose importance to the subsequent development of modern American poetry in the twentieth century grew out of his commitment to recording the “local” experience of Rutherford, New Jersey and its environs. From 1909 until the early 1930s, Williams’s poetry appeared in small journals and specialist editions, but the founding of New Directions by James Laughlin brought the author and young publisher together, and Williams subsequently published the majority of his remaining life’s work with Laughlin’s company.</description>

      <description>Robert Cornell Kaufman was the thirteenth of fourteen children born to a German Jewish father and a mother from Martinique. His great-grandmother, brought to Louisiana on an African slave ship, was a great influence in his youth, as was his father’s Orthodox Judaism and his mother’s devout Roman Catholicism. After the death of his father, Bob Kaufman left home to become cabin boy on a freighter. The first mate took a fatherly interest in the 13-year-old boy, instilling in him a thirst for literature and the arts, providing him with books by the world’s great writers.</description>

After composing the brilliant prose poetry of A Season in Hell and the groundbreaking Illuminations, Rimbaud left France for Java and Abyssinia, where he worked under the employ of various trading companies until returning to France to have his right leg amputated in Marseille.</description>

      <description>Hasan Shah was born in India around 1770, and though he worked as a clerk, or munshi, to an English officer, he was in no way aware of the European literary tradition, and probably did not even speak English. Nevertheless, writing in Persian at the age of twenty, exposed only to medieval romances and epics, Hasan Shah created the first modern Indian novel. According to Shah’s English translator, Qurratulain Hyder, The Dancing Girl is an homage to Shah’s late wife, and to traditional Persian ghazals, but in its sensibility, it is entirely modern.</description>

      <description>Born in Montevideo of French parents in 1884, Jules Supervielle was raised by wealthy relatives after being orphaned at an early age. He showed an early interest in writing and completed his first work, Brumes du passe by 1900. An enthusiastic student, Supervielle could not decide between law, political science, art, languages (he was proficient in Italian, English and Portuguese) and literature—to which he finally devoted his whole life. In 1910 he published his second work, Comme des voiliers as well as fragments of what could have been his thesis, but his writing career was interrupted by World War I and Supervielle was drafted into the French army.</description>

His poems are characterized by such an unusual range of concerns that he often began his poetry readings by wryly asking the audience: &amp;ldquo;Well, what would you like tonight: sex, mysticism or revolution?&amp;ldquo; Though almost entirely self-educated, his erudition was astonishingly broad-ranging, as reflected in essays on topics as diverse as ancient Chinese science, modern jazz, American Indian songs, California mountaineering, medieval mysticism, avant-garde art and utopian communities.</description>

A contemporary of the Cubist painters and Surrealists, he was in touch with both groups, but far closer, as we see him now in perspective, with the Cubists.</description>

      <description>Stéphane Mallarmé (1842–1898) was the great French Symbolist poet. According to his theories, nothing lies beyond reality, but within this nothingness lies the essence of perfect forms and it is the task of the poet to reveal and crystallize these essences. Mallarmé’s poetry employs condensed figures and unorthodox syntax. Each poem is built around a central symbol, idea, or metaphor and consists of subordinate images that illustrate and help to develop the idea.</description>

      <description>Bankim-Chandra Chatterjee (1838-1894) was born in the village of Katalpara near Naihati. His novels firmly laid the foundation of the Indian novel. Indeed, Chatterjee is the father of the Indian novel - and one of the greatest Indian novelists. The Chatterjees were an orthodox Brahman family; thus early family influences probably had something to do with the conservative attitudes in religious and social matters so noticeable in Bankim’s writings. He was one of the first two graduates of the newly founded Calcutta University.</description>

      <description>Charles Baudelaire (1821–1867) was born in Paris, France. Controversial during his lifetime (of his hometown he wrote: “Paris, a center radiating universal stupidity”) Baudelaire was a dandy who dug himself deeply into debt by spending recklessly on clothing, opium, and prostitutes (prostitutes from whom he likely contracted his crippling syphilis). He considered Edgar Allen Poe his “soul’s twin” and produced highly-acclaimed translations of the macabre American storyteller. His tortured relations with his mother and stepfather are considered by certain biographers to be the foundation of his erratic character (Baudelaire referred to his stepfather as “The General”).</description>

      <description>An innovative modernist writer, Hilda Doolittle (1886–1961) wrote under her initials in a career that stretched from 1909 to 1961. Although she is most well known for her poetry—lyric and epic—H.D. also wrote novels, memoirs, short stories, essays, reviews, a children’s book, and translations. An American woman who lived her adult life abroad, H.D. was engaged in the formalist experimentation that preoccupied much of her generation. A range of thematic concerns resonates through her writing: the role of the poet, the civilian representation of war, material and mythologized ancient cultures, the role of national and colonial identity, lesbian and queer sexuality, and religion and spirituality.</description>

Borges was born in Buenos Aires and is the author of numerous collections of fiction, poetry, and essays. His groundbreaking trans-genre work, Labyrinths, has been insinuating itself into the structure, stance, and very breath of world literature for well over half a century. Writing that is multi-layered, self-referential, elusive, and allusive is now labeled Borgesian. &amp;ldquo;Jorge Luis Borges is a central fact of Western culture.</description>
