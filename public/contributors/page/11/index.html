      Amelia Rosselli (1930–1996), often said to be one of the best Italian writers of her generation, was heavily influenced by traumatic events in her youth. When Rosselli was only seven, her father and uncle, two leaders of the anti-Fascist Resistance, were brutally assassinated by the Fascist secret service. Then, when she was seventeen, her mother died and Rosselli suffered her first nervous breakdown. The deaths of her parents left her with lifelong paranoia, depression and what she called an emotional void.

      Wang An-shih (1021–1086) was a remarkable figure—not only one of the great Song Dynasty poets but also the most influential and controversial statesman of his time. Wang rose to the position of Prime Minister, where he instituted a controversial system of radically egalitarian social reforms in an effort to improve the lives of China’s peasants. Wang then left politics and retired to a reclusive artistic and spiritual life of self-cultivation. Wang spent those later years practicing Ch’an (Zen) Buddhism and wandering the mountains around his home, and that Taoist civilization of the rivers-and-mountains realm shapes his poems.

      A poet, writer, and artist, Ferreira Gullar (b. 1930), the pen name of José Ribamar Ferreira, is the central figure of the Brazilian poetry movement the Neo-Concretes. Exiled by the Brazilian government from 1964 to 1985, Gullar worried that he’d meet the gruesome fate of so many other exiled writers and this fear inspired him to write his best-known work, Poema Sujo, or Dirty Poem. The poem spans one hundred pages and was written to be a sort of last will and testament.

In 1902 she moved to Munich and became friends with notable avant-garde thinkers and writers such as Thomas Mann, Hans Carossa, and Rainer Maria Rilke.

      From &ldquo;The Book Jackets of Alvin Lustig&rdquo; by James Laughlin, Print Magazine, Oct/Nov 1956
 The first jacket which Lustig did for a New Directions Book — the one for the 1941 edition of _Henry Miller’s Wisdom of the Heart —_ was quite unlike anything then in vogue, but it scarcely hinted at the extraordinary flowering which was to follow. It was rather stiff and severe - a non-representational construction made from little pieces of type metal chosen from the cases in the experimental printing shop he had set up in the hinter regions of a drugstore in Brentwood.

      One of the most significant contributors to twentieth-century Argentine poetry, Alejandra Pizarnik made a name for herself through her dark themes and diction. Heavily influenced by Rimbaud and Artaud, Pizarnik believed that suffering was intrinsic to the creation of great poetry. This concession to misery was apparent in her work as her writing was often filled with themes of solitude, estrangement, madness, and death—yet also included moments of tenderness. During her short lifetime she wrote seven books of poetry and one book of prose, as well as numerous translations, short stories, essays, and drawings.

      Nikolai Gogol (1809–1852) was a novelist and political satirist. Born in Sorochintsi, Ukraine, he grew up on his parents’ country estate. In 1828 Gogol, an aspiring writer, settled in St. Petersburg, with a certificate attesting his right to “the rank of the 14th class.” To support himself Gogol worked minor governmental jobs and wrote occasionally for periodicals. Although he was interested in literature, he also dreamed of becoming an actor. However, the capital of Russia did not welcome him with open arms and his early narrative poem, Hans Küchelgarten (1829), turned out to be a disaster.

He was a major force in the revival of Hinduism in India and contributed to the notion of nationalism in colonial India.

      Nobel Prize Laureate and beloved Swedish poet Tomas Tranströmer (1931–2015) was born in Stockholm and worked as a psychologist. He wrote ten collections of poems that the Nobel Prize Committee praised for their “condensed, translucent images that give us fresh access to reality.” New Directions publishes his complete poems in one volume titled The Great Enigma: New Collected Poems. Tranströmer was first published by New Directions in 1966, in New Directions in Prose &amp; Poetry #16.

      William Carlos Williams (1883–1963) was a poet, short-story writer, novelist and essayist whose importance to the subsequent development of modern American poetry in the twentieth century grew out of his commitment to recording the “local” experience of Rutherford, New Jersey and its environs. From 1909 until the early 1930s, Williams’s poetry appeared in small journals and specialist editions, but the founding of New Directions by James Laughlin brought the author and young publisher together, and Williams subsequently published the majority of his remaining life’s work with Laughlin’s company.

      Before he permanently gave up poetry at the age of twenty-one, Arthur Rimbaud (1854–1891) created some of the finest French verse in history. Son of a domineering mother, Rimbaud was a brilliant student who became unruly and rebellious in his teenage years, joining the Paris Commune of 1871 and entering a torrid affair with the poet Paul Verlaine. After composing the brilliant prose poetry of A Season in Hell and the groundbreaking Illuminations, Rimbaud left France for Java and Abyssinia, where he worked under the employ of various trading companies until returning to France to have his right leg amputated in Marseille.

      Poet, art critic, translator, and editor are just a few words that could be used to describe Edouard Roditi (1910–1992). Born in Paris in 1910 to American parents, Roditi was educated in England and began writing and translating at a very young age. He was seventeen when his first poem was published and his poems were experimental and rich with imagery. Roditi’s poetry often confronted anti-semitism and included Judaic themes. In Paris Roditi was closely associated with the surrealist movement and created the first English translation of Andre Breton’s Surrealist Manifesto.

      Hasan Shah was born in India around 1770, and though he worked as a clerk, or munshi, to an English officer, he was in no way aware of the European literary tradition, and probably did not even speak English. Nevertheless, writing in Persian at the age of twenty, exposed only to medieval romances and epics, Hasan Shah created the first modern Indian novel. According to Shah’s English translator, Qurratulain Hyder, The Dancing Girl is an homage to Shah’s late wife, and to traditional Persian ghazals, but in its sensibility, it is entirely modern.

In 1910 he published his second work, Comme des voiliers as well as fragments of what could have been his thesis, but his writing career was interrupted by World War I and Supervielle was drafted into the French army.

      Bankim-Chandra Chatterjee (1838-1894) was born in the village of Katalpara near Naihati. His novels firmly laid the foundation of the Indian novel. Indeed, Chatterjee is the father of the Indian novel - and one of the greatest Indian novelists. The Chatterjees were an orthodox Brahman family; thus early family influences probably had something to do with the conservative attitudes in religious and social matters so noticeable in Bankim’s writings. He was one of the first two graduates of the newly founded Calcutta University.

      Charles Baudelaire (1821–1867) was born in Paris, France. Controversial during his lifetime (of his hometown he wrote: “Paris, a center radiating universal stupidity”) Baudelaire was a dandy who dug himself deeply into debt by spending recklessly on clothing, opium, and prostitutes (prostitutes from whom he likely contracted his crippling syphilis). He considered Edgar Allen Poe his “soul’s twin” and produced highly-acclaimed translations of the macabre American storyteller. His tortured relations with his mother and stepfather are considered by certain biographers to be the foundation of his erratic character (Baudelaire referred to his stepfather as “The General”).

      An innovative modernist writer, Hilda Doolittle (1886–1961) wrote under her initials in a career that stretched from 1909 to 1961. Although she is most well known for her poetry—lyric and epic—H.D. also wrote novels, memoirs, short stories, essays, reviews, a children’s book, and translations. An American woman who lived her adult life abroad, H.D. was engaged in the formalist experimentation that preoccupied much of her generation. A range of thematic concerns resonates through her writing: the role of the poet, the civilian representation of war, material and mythologized ancient cultures, the role of national and colonial identity, lesbian and queer sexuality, and religion and spirituality.

      The great Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986) defies classification. Borges was born in Buenos Aires and is the author of numerous collections of fiction, poetry, and essays. His groundbreaking trans-genre work, Labyrinths, has been insinuating itself into the structure, stance, and very breath of world literature for well over half a century. Writing that is multi-layered, self-referential, elusive, and allusive is now labeled Borgesian. &ldquo;Jorge Luis Borges is a central fact of Western culture.

      Robert White Creeley (1926–2005), poet, novelist, short story writer, essayist, editor, and teacher was born in Arlington, Massachusetts. He entered Harvard University in 1943, leaving after one year to drive an ambulance in the India-Burma theater of World War II. He returned to Harvard in 1945 and helped edit Harvard Wake, no. 5, a special E.E. Cummings issue, in which Creeley’s first published poem, &ldquo;Return,&rdquo; appeared. After dropping out of Harvard during the last semester of his senior year, he started a close and fruitful friendship with Cid Corman and helped launch Corman’s magazine, Origin, which became the vehicle that most promoted Creeley’s poetry in the 1950s.

After Navy service in World War II, he worked in the mail room at Time Magazine for a while, then lived in Paris (1947–1951), where he received a Doctorat de l’Universite from the Sorbonne in 1949.

      Osamu Dazai was born in 1909 into a powerful landowning family of Northern Japan. A brilliant student, he entered the French Department of Tokyo University in 1930, but later boasted that in the five years before he left without a degree he had never attended a lecture. He attempted suicide in 1935, leaving behind an envelope of stories which he expected to be posthumously published as The Declining Years. His early works are filled with invention and wit, but it was after the war that he reached his full stature, first with the short story, &ldquo;Villon&rsquo;s Wife&rdquo; (translated by Donald Keene and published in New Directions 15) and then with The Setting Sun, which created an immediate sensation when it was published in 1947.
