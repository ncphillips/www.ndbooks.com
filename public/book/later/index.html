<p>The epigraph to <em>Later</em>, Robert Creeley’s second book of poems published by New Directions, enjoins the reader to &ldquo;hold in mind/ All that has loved you or been kind.&rdquo; This commitment to the continuity of life on a fragile planet, limited by both time and space, has become increasingly important to a poet who, &ldquo;if older,&rdquo; takes a certain pride in knowing the boundaries of the possible. Where his 1978 verse journal Hello chronicled an actual journey (to New Zealand, Australia, and the Far East), <em>Later</em> deals with an interior exploration rooted in everyday sights and sounds––the play of light and shadow through a window, the lap of waves on a beach. Past occurrences and expectations are reconciled with an acceptance of inevitable change, and in the poignant title sequence Creeley marvels, &ldquo;but now the wonder of life is/ that it is at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reality and fantasy are interwoven with terrifying power as two actors on tour––brother and sister––find themselves deserted by the troupe in a decrepit &ldquo;state theatre in an unknown state.&rdquo; Faced (perhaps) by an audience expecting a performance, they enact &ldquo;The Two-Character Play&rdquo;––an illusion within an illusion, an &ldquo;out cry&rdquo; from isolation, panic, and fear. &ldquo;I think it is my most beautiful play since Streetcar,&rdquo; Tennessee Williams said, &ldquo;and I’ve never stopped working on it… It is a cri de coeur, but then all creative work, all life, in a sense is a cri de coeur.&rdquo; In the course of its evolution, several earlier versions of <em>The Two-Character Play</em> have been produced. The first of them was presented in 1967 in London and Chicago and brought out in 1969 by New Directions in a signed limited edition. The next, staged in 1973 in New York under the title <em>Out Cry</em>, was published by New Directions in 1973. The third version (New York 1975), again titled <em>The Two-Character Play</em>, is the one Tennessee Williams wished to include in Volume V of The Theatre of Tennessee Williams. It is this most recent version which is presented in this ND Paperbook.</p>

<p>“There is no contemporary prose work from which I have got so much pleasure and profit,” Sir Herbert Read writes in his preface to this book. “The pleasure comes from the texture––a prose style which, in an age that has forsaken the art of prose, gleams with such expressive beauty… It is the crystalline vein of the English Bible, of Shakespeare and Sir Thomas Browne, running through the torpid substance of modern life… and is as relevant to our present condition as any book of wisdom… “It is a work of criticism and exposition. Shakespeare, Dostoevski, Cervantes, Thoreau, Melville, Whitman, Rilke, Randolph Bourne… these are the prophets to be expounded, related, excoriated (stripped of accretions of platitude and misunderstanding). But behind them are the original prophets, the great Hebrew prophets, and the greatest prophet of them all, the Galilean. Turning and returning to these Hebraic forebears, Dahlberg taps some source of collective energy, some fire-laden force of anger and denunciation, some heaven-lit clarity of vision.”</p>

<h2 id="slug-end-to-torment">_slug: end-to-torment</h2>

<p><em>End to Torment: A Memoir of Ezra Pound</em> is the deeply personal journal kept by the poet H. D. (Hilda Doolittle. 1886-1961) in 1958, the year Ezra Pound was released from St. Elizabeth’s in Washington, D.C., and returned to Italy. H. D., hospitalized in Switzerland from a fall, was urged to put down on paper, once and for all, her memories of Pound, which reached back to 1905, when she was a freshman at Bryn Mawr and he a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania. They had been engaged for a period, and what began as a brief romance developed into a lifetime’s friendship and collaboration in poetry. Throughout the reminiscence runs H. D’s conviction that her life and Pound’s had been irrevocably entwined since those early days when they had walked together in the Pennsylvania woods and he wrote for her verse after William Morris, Rossetti, Swinburne, and Chaucer. Twenty-five of these poems, handbound in vellum by Pound and called &ldquo;Hilda’s Book,&rdquo; are published here for the first time as an epilogue to this important and moving document.</p>

<p>With <em>The River and the Train</em>, Edwin Brock’s sixth collection to be published by New Directions, this British author shifts his focus from the brutality and desperate compromise of urban existence to the more pastoral though no less complex irony of life in a converted East Anglian granary. The bitter anger of such earlier books as <em>The Blocked Heart</em> (1976) and the prose and verse &ldquo;Fragments of a Childhood&rdquo; <em>Here. Now. Always.</em> (1977) has not disappeared but has been dispersed and mellowed by the poet’s life with his second wife, artist Elizabeth Brock, and their daughter &ldquo;Fred.&rdquo; Wistful, sardonic, Brock now fantasizes &ldquo;not reincarnation/so much as sometime-loop/which returns me to/where I started to go wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The humble but heroic figure of St. Francis (1182-1226), who gave up wealth and security to espouse a life of poverty, an apostolic existence as much like Christ’s as possible, attracted a strong and immediate following. In a series of vivid vignettes, <em>The Wisdom of St. Francis and His Companions</em> portrays the lives of the original members of the Franciscan community––the childlike innocence of their faith, their brave self-denial and acute sayings, and the sometimes comic effects of their simplicity. St. Francis himself was a poet, and his work, together with the picturesque episodes of his extraordinary life, evoke a perennial response––as witness his revered “Canticle to the Sun.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="slug-the-wisdom-of-the-spanish-mystics">_slug: the-wisdom-of-the-spanish-mystics</h2>

<p>The great flowering of Catholic mysticism in sixteenth-century Spain has had a lasting effect on that country’s religious life. Stephen Clissold’s <em>The Wisdom of the Spanish Mystics</em> provides a selection of maxims and excerpts from the writings of over twenty visionaries. Represented here are such well-known figures as the poet and theologian St. John of the Cross, St. Theresa of Avila, a woman of great charm and practical ability as well as acute spiritual insight, and St. Ignatius Loyola, the invalided soldier who founded the Society of Jesus. But scarcely less extraordinary are the Majorcan missionary and scholar Ramón Lull, the saintly Jesuit doorkeeper Alonso Rodriguez, and Maria Vela, another nun from Avila whose autobiography has recently come to light. The introduction places these remarkable men and women in the historical and cultural context of a Christian Spain triumphant in its nearly eight-hundred-year struggle with its Moslem adversaries, and outlines their relation to the central Catholic mystical tradition. This new volume will be of special interest to readers familiar with Thomas Merton’s <em>The Wisdom of the Desert</em>, the collection of savings from the Desert Fathers that inspired the ongoing New Directions Wisdom Series.</p>

<h2 id="slug-words-and-silence">_slug: words-and-silence</h2>

<p><em>Words and Silence: On the Poetry of Thomas Merton</em> brings to the study of the late Trappist monk’s verse the special perceptions born of a friendship of nearly three decades’ duration. It started with a brief correspondence between two poets in 1939, two years before Merton entered the monastery of Gethsemani in Kentucky, and lasted until his tragic accidental death in 1968. Throughout these years, Sister Therese Lentfoehr held a number of university positions in her native Wisconsin and elsewhere, all the while amassing an extensive Merton archival collection, including various drafts of individual poems and prose pieces, translations, books and pamphlets, and even portions of hand-written private journals. The comparison of variant readings––sometimes three or four drafts of a single poem-–proved invaluable in preparing this study. But of greater worth was the continued intellectual sharing that not only gave Sister Therese growing insight into Merton the monk and contemplative but afforded her a working understanding, as it were, of his poetic vision. Beginning with his pre-Trappist writing and his first published collection in 1911, Sister Therese systematically analyses the entire corpus of Merton’s poetry––the earlier monastic preoccupations to the later Zen influences, the recurrent religious and social themes, the increasingly surreal imagery, and the developing “antipoetry” of his final books. Provided with a bibliography and index, <em>Words and Silence</em> is a recommended companion to <em>The Collected Poems of Thomas Merton</em> (1977), a key to the very mind and spirit of an extraordinary monk and poet.</p>

<p>Denise Levertov’s <em>Collected Earlier Poems 1940-1960</em> brings under one cover the first published works of a poet who, though born and raised in Great Britain, has long held a distinctive place in postwar American letters. Initiating a major literary undertaking, the volume includes a group of hitherto ungathered poems, selections from Ms. Levertov’s earliest book, <em>The Double Image</em> (1946), published in London, and her three following collections in their entirety: <em>Here and Now</em> (1957), <em>Overland to the Islands</em> (1958), and <em>With Eyes at the Back of Our Heads</em> (1960). Living in the United States since the late 1940s, Ms. Levertov has often been associated with the Black Mountain poets, while from the mid- 1960s onward she has been one of the foremost activists in the antiwar and anti-nuclear movements. Yet even in her more &ldquo;political&rdquo; poems, her dominant perception has continued to be of the intricate beauty, the mystery of life as it is lived. In announcing Ms. Levertov the winner of the 1975 Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize, Hayden Carruth said of her: &ldquo;For twenty-five years Denise Levertov has been one of our most prominent poets… Today she is a woman at the crest of her maturity, acute in perceptions, wise in responses, and an artist, moreover, whose technique has kept pace with her personal development.&rdquo; With <em>Collected Earlier Poems 1940-1960</em>, readers have the opportunity of following Ms. Levertov’s remarkable poetic development from its very beginnings.</p>

<p><em>The Woman on the Bridge over the Chicago River</em> is Allen Grossman’s first collection with New Directions. His voice is astonishingly contemporary, his often dissociated imagery bordering on the surreal––yet one hears in his verse classical and Biblical echoes and, on occasion, darker medieval undertones. The brilliance of his imagination works against a measured eloquence, setting up a fine-edged tension not unlike the prophetic verse of William Blake, the wild dithyrambs of David, or the more controlled metrics of Catullus and Villon.</p>

<p>Since its inception in 1936, the <em>New Directions in Prose and Poetry</em> anthology series has been at the very core of the ND list. Of special interest in this the thirty-eighth number is a variety of visual and graphic materials that strives to extend the concept of the written word. David Antin’s &ldquo;real estate,&rdquo; a lengthy and highly entertaining narrative, is reproduced from the author’s own transcription of his improvised &ldquo;talk poem.&rdquo; Poet and critic Dick Higgins contributes two concrete poems. And from the late Russian man of letters, Aleksei Remizov (1877-1957) come eight remarkable drawings, introduced by the exiled Estonian poet and critic Aleksis Rannit. Also included are: Lawrence Ferlinghetti’s &ldquo;Second Populist Manifesto: Adieu a CharIot&rdquo;; James Purdy’s bizarre &ldquo;Anonymous/Anomalous Letters of Passion&rdquo;; &ldquo;The Face at the Bottom of the World,&rdquo; a poem sequence by Betsy Adams; &ldquo;Klaus von Stauffenberg Reads His Palm While Shooting Niagara,&rdquo; from Paul West’s fictionalized account of one of Hitler’s leading generals; Peter Kurinsky’s &ldquo;The Investigation,” a tale of a young man’s unearthing of family skeletons; a newly translated story, &ldquo;Blues for a Black Cat,&rdquo; by the late French author Boris Vian (1920-59); &ldquo;The Flies,&rdquo; an evocation of a writer’s idyl gone awry, by the Faroese author William Heinesen; &ldquo;Six Prose Poems&rdquo; by the young Mexican-American poet Jimmy Santiago Baca; &ldquo;Buried Alive,&rdquo; a cryptic narrative of political repression by the Spanish writer Ramón Hernández.</p>

<p><em>The Harditts in Sawna</em> is the third volume of Robert Nichols’s utopian tetralogy, <em>Daily Lives in Nghsi-Altai</em>. In the previous books (<em>Arrival</em> and <em>Garh City</em>), we were treated to tantalizing glimpses of the imaginary central Asian country of Nghsi-Altai seen through the eyes of three travelers from the West, followed by an investigation of the city in a technologically advanced society which yet maintains an elaborate, &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; kinship system. We now turn to six narratives of village life, focusing on members of the Harditt family. Maddi, a twelve-year-old schoolgirl; Dhillon, a farm apprentice; his married older brother, Srikant––these are the Harditt children of earlier volumes. &ldquo;Women in Middle Age&rdquo; tells of Sathan, their mother, and Nanda, their aunt, and the workings of the matriarchy in Sawna. An account is then given of the death of the grandfather, Old Harditt, and his translation into the family’s Ancestor Society. And finally, we see Venu, Sathan’s husband, as an elected official of the Wind Brotherhood of solar engineers. These are not, however, tales of individuals in the usual sense but probes in the web of relationships that constitutes a communal society, the widening circle of clan, tribe, and phratry. Each story, moreover, reveals an aspect of a delicate political-industrial balance––for the world of Nghsi-Altai is modern, indeed a paradigm of an alternate society.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;melo-melo in seven scenes,&rdquo; <em>Just Wild About Harry</em> is Henry Miller’s only excursion into playwriting. <em>Harry</em> is pure Miller, welling up from the same abundant love of life and freedom from convention that made its author the dean of writers dedicated to human liberation. Admittedly inspired by lonesco and the Theatre of the Absurd, Miller’s tragicomic slapstick is nevertheless as American as the Marx Brothers and the blues––the simple story of a heartless Harry (the one the ladies are wild about) who learns a bittersweet lesson about life, death, and love. Begun in Europe in 1960, <em>Just Wild About Harry</em> was first published by New Directions in 1963.</p>

<h2 id="slug-the-rise-of-the-french-novel">_slug: the-rise-of-the-french-novel</h2>

<p>Martin Turnell’s <em>The Rise of the French Novel</em> is a successor to his highly praised earlier books, <em>The Novel in France</em> (1951) and <em>The Art of French Fiction</em> (1959). His aim now, however, is somewhat different, as can be seen from the title. It is well known that the reputations of many writers, novelists especially, diminish for a period following their deaths. Although in the eighteenth century Marivaux, Crébillon fils, and Rousseau all enjoyed a great deal of popularity during their lifetimes, it is only recently that they have been subject to truly searching studies. Yet they remain little read in English-speaking countries. Turnell emphasizes that in spite of the hostility of French critics and the fact that the novel did not reach its supremacy even in France until the nineteenth century, the beginning of its great rise was indeed with such writers as these. Their strong influence led such nineteenth-century novelists as Stendhal and Flaubert to all kinds of changes related to style, the enormous increase in the range of subject matter, and the marked development of language. Flaubert is the most striking example. It was pointed out some time ago by Eisenstein that <em>Madame Bovary</em> anticipates cinematic technique. One of Turnell’s most interesting chapters explores the connections between the novel and film in general, and <em>Madame Bovary</em> in particular. In our own time, two of the most popular French novelists in both the United States and England are Alain-Fournier and Radiguet. They are given enthusiastic appreciations in Turnell’s thoughtful book.</p>

Ms. Levertov’s work holds that tenuous yet inspiring ground between reflection and discourse. The dynamics of this sensitive balance is pointed up in <em>Life in the Forest</em> by a thematic grouping which invites internal association from poem to poem and section to section. “The poems I had been moving towards,” she explains, “were impelled by two forces: first, a recurring need…to vary a habitual lyric mode; not to abandon it, by any means, but from time to time explore more expansive means; and second, the decision to try to avoid over use of the autobiographical, the dominant first-person singular of so much American poetry—good and bad—of recent years.”</p>

<p><em>Where Silence Reigns</em>, a sampling from his essays, notebooks, and letters, shows Rainer Maria Rilke (1875-1926), the pre-eminent modern poet of solitude and inwardness, seeking to reconcile his personal conflict between the claims of &ldquo;life&rdquo; and the claims of art. His subjects are commonplace, seemingly innocuous at times: the encounter between a man and a dog, a collection of dolls, a walk among trees. But always the deceptively simple external phenomenon is seen as the symbol, the catalyst of an intensely felt inner experience. As he confided to his friend Frau Wunderly-Volkart: &ldquo;Oh, how often one longs to speak a few degrees more deeply! My prose&hellip; lies deeper&hellip; but one gets only a minimal layer further down; one’s left with a mere intimation of the kind of speech that may be possible THERE where silence reigns.&rdquo; In addition to occasional pieces and notebook entries, this volume contains selections from the strange and haunting &ldquo;Dream-Book,&rdquo; the lyrical &ldquo;Lay of the Love and Death of Cornet Christoph Rilke,&rdquo; and the entire &ldquo;Rodin-Book&rdquo;––Rilke’s appreciation of the great sculptor whom he had served as secretary.</p>

<p><em>Prince Friedrich of Homburg</em> is the indisputable dramatic masterpiece of Heinrich von Kleist (1777-1811), a leading figure, along with Goethe and Schiller, among early German Romantics. Available until now only in verse translation, it has been newly rendered for the American stage by Diana Stone Peters and Frederick G. Peters. A work of profound psychological insight, Prince Friedrich of Homburg probes with passionate intensity questions fundamental to &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; behavior. Prince Friedrich, the hero of the historic battle of Fehrbellin (1675) against the invading Swedes, receives not laurels for his victory but the sentence of death for disobeying orders in the field. Faced with certain execution, his mood swings from abject terror to high-minded exultation as first he challenges, and then accepts, the rule of law and subservience to the state. The action moves relentlessly in the near-frenzied pace characteristic of Kleist. Intended as a paean to a Prussia triumphant in the Napoleonic wars, the play was, ironically, censured and never produced in Kleist’s lifetime. In our own day, Prince Friedrich of Homburg has been both denounced as a protofascist work and lauded as a supreme metaphysical disquisition. Whatever the merits of such intellectualization, it remains one of the most moving and performable plays available for the modern stage.</p>

<p>Virginia Woolf, in a mixture of distaste and admiration, called them &ldquo;the literary underworld,&rdquo; although their names were in the mainstream in the England of World War I and the 1920s. Today for the most part unfamiliar, then they connected variously, and not unimportantly, with Shaw and H. G. Wells, Aldous Huxley and D.H. Lawrence, not to overlook Pound, Eliot, E. M. Forster, and Edwin Muir, among countless others. The pages of A. R. Orage’s <em>The New Age</em> and John Middleton Murry’s numerous periodicals (<em>Rhythm</em>, <em>The Blue Review</em>, <em>The Athenaeum</em>, <em>Adelphi</em>) were the intellectual forums of their day, the mirrors of the trends in taste and social concerns. The five principals in John Carswell’s gracious, perceptive reminiscence were not of a single coterie. Rather, they shared in a particular kind of literary life: professional without being academic, dedicated without being regimented, all were devoted to careers which were often the only source of their livelihoods. In the final analysis, none were creative giants: Katherine Mansfield now remembered less for her stories, and Murry for his criticism, than as Lawrence’s Gudrun and Gerald (<em>Women in Love</em>); &ldquo;Kot’s&rdquo; role in introducing Russian literature becomes a dim footnote; the wild Beatrice Hastings perhaps glimpsed in a biography of Modigliani in Bohemian Paris; the fine imprint of Orage’s editorial genius, faded. Yet they were intrinsic to their time, and their serious and passionate lives and letters are quickened in these glowing pages.</p>

<p>The British writer Katherine Mansfield (1888-1923) is best known for the penetrating irony of her frequently anthologized short stories. In this major reinterpretation of her life and work, first published in 1980 and now being made available in paperbound format, Jeffrey Meyers sees Katherine Mansfield as a passionate and tragic heroine who could control her art but not her life. Basing his assessment on a wide range of interviews and extensive research of published and unpublished sources in New Zealand, England, and America, Meyers reveals a less idealized but more readily understandable Mansfield. He examines in some detail her rebellious reaction to her colonial background, her self-destructive revolt against respectability, and her stormy emotional life: her lesbian friendships, her early love affairs, miscarriage, and abortion; her one-day marriage; and her extraordinary relationship with John Middleton Murry. The quest for health and a cure from rapidly advancing tuberculosis dominated her last years. Giving up on orthodox medicine, she resorted to the mysticism of Gurdjieff, at whose Institute in France she died at the age of thirty-four. This biography links the tempestuous events of her short life with her development as a writer and also explores the influence of her friendships with many of her contemporaries, from D. H. Lawrence to Virginia Woolf.</p>

His writing in recent years is &ldquo;alchemical&rdquo; in its intent, yet his twin declarations, &ldquo;Biology Is Politics&rdquo; and &ldquo;I Am A Mammal Patriot,&rdquo; perhaps express more accurately both the universality of his outlook and its humane particularity.

In the dancing lines of his newest work––the title poem &ldquo;Antechamber&rdquo; most especially––are the whirl of galaxies, the radiance of molecules, the energy lines of the double helix coiling around its core.</p>

<p>Gary Snyder’s second collection, <em>Myths &amp; Texts</em>, was originally published in 1960 by Totem Press in association with Corinth Books. It has been reissued by New Directions in a completely revised format, with a new introduction by the author. The three sequences in the books––&rdquo;Logging,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hunting,&rdquo; &ldquo;Burning&rdquo;––show the remarkable cohesiveness in Snyder’s writings over the years, for we find the poet absorbed, then as now, with Buddhist and Amerindian lore and other interconnections East and West, but above all with the primeval devotion to the land and work. &ldquo;I set this poem loose on the world some years ago,&rdquo; Snyder writes. &ldquo;It looks like an old friend I haven’t seen in a while&hellip; The effort of this kind of poetry remains one of our most challenging enterprises: here on Occupied Turtle Island, we are most of us a still restless population of non-natives who don’t even know the plants or where our water comes from. Myself, raised in the West, in the basin of Puget Sound, what some poets now call Ish Nation, set out like everyone else, to make sense, and to find somehow a way to actually ’belong to the land.’&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Seasons of Sacred Lust</em> is Kazuko Shiraishi’s challenge to the conventions of Japanese erotic poetry. Born in Vancouver, Canada, Shiraishi was taken to Japan by her family just prior to World War II, and her first poetry (written at age seventeen, published at twenty) emerged from the violence and ugliness of postwar Tokyo. Her earliest work, associated with the avant-garde magazine <em>Vou</em>, shows her talent for vivid, bizarre, almost surrealistic imagery. Her later writing, coming out of her deepening involvement in the world of modern jazz and her increasing emphasis on the performance of her poetry, dramatizes a society of estrangement and alienation where music and poetry provide the only values, and sex the only solace, in a disintegrating world. This selection is translated by a group of Japanese and American poets: Iluko Atsumi, John Solt, Carol Tinker, Yasuyo Morita, and Kenneth Rexroth who provided an informative, perceptive introduction.</p>

<p>With a lilt––“’That’s the way / (that’s the way) / I like it / (I like it)’”––Robert Creeley begins his verse journal <em>Hello</em>, the record of a whirlwind tour of Southeast Asia. Starting in Fiji, he then spent a month in New Zealand (the trip having been sponsored by the New Zealand Arts Council), followed in a few weeks’ time by stays in Australia, Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Japan, and Korea. It was a singular experience, coming as it did at a time of much change in the poet’s personal life. He went, as he remarks in a postscript, &ldquo;because I wanted to––to look, to see, even if briefly, how people in those parts of the world made a reality, to talk of being American, of the past war, of power, of usual life in this country, of my fellow and sister poets, of my neighbors on Fargo Street in Buffalo, New York. I wanted, at last, to be human, however simplistic that wish. I took thus my own chances and remarkably found a company.&rdquo; The text is a graph of outward detail and inner change, kaleidoscopic in its sense of moving from place to place, warm in its feeling of being at home in the human community.</p>

<p>Edouard Roditi’s <em>The Delights of Turkey</em> is a confection that reminds us that short fiction need not be only a relentless probing of everyday anguish. Here is a score of witty and ingenious stories, set for the most part in Asia Minor, where the centuries-long mingling of Turks and Armenians, Greeks and Jews has evolved a vibrant culture rich in diversity. The tales are often bawdy or fanciful in the manner of the <em>Thousand and One Nights</em>, while others are more poignantly humorous in style, as we meet pasha, princess, and peasant, become privy to the intrigues of the Ottoman harem, or follow the merchant caravans on their journeys east. The collection itself is arranged thematically in four parts. &ldquo;A City Built on Seven Hills&rdquo; sketches a timeless Istanbul. &ldquo;The Chronicles of Bok Köy&rdquo; tell of an Anatolian village and the legendary prowess of its young men, the redoubtable Achmet Hodja most especially. In &ldquo;Orient Express&rdquo; baffled European meets mysterious Levantine. The last section, &ldquo;The Eternal and Ubiquitous City&rdquo; returns once more to Istanbul, this time in its contemporary guise.</p>

<h2 id="slug-arrival">_slug: arrival</h2>

<p>We are about to penetrate an imaginary land in central Asia. Nghsi-Altai––a place no better or worse than the United States, merely its opposite. Consider this: a country with an advanced, ecologically balanced technology but a rigid, even &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; social organization, where a communalized political structure exists in harmony with a priestly yet mystical religion. It is as if the Industrial Revolution had come to northern India in the ninth century or, in our own time, Bakunin and Kropotkin had gained control of the First International and the anarchists of Catalonia had won the Civil War in Spain. Here, then, is the setting of Arrival, the first book of Robert Nichols’s sequence of four novels, <em>Daily Lives in Nghsi-Altai</em>. Three visitors from the West––a novelist, a visionary, a revolutionist, filmmaker––move through this seemingly kaleidoscopic world. Landscapes and livelihoods, ceremonies and manufactures are not so much described as progressively discovered, as each explorer in his own way comes to familiarize himself with the alien society of Nghsi-Altai. Call it what you will––adventure or utopian literature, science-fiction perhaps––Nichols’s tetralogy is not novelistic literature in the conventional sense but rather an extended improvisation, anecdotal in the telling, compelling in its ideas, exuberant in its humor. Further volumes in this series will be issued periodically by New Directions.</p>

<h2 id="slug-possibility-of-being">_slug: possibility-of-being</h2>

<p><em>Possibility of Being</em> is a selection of poems by one of the most moving and original writers of this century, Rainer Maria Rilke (1857-l926). The title (taken from one of the <em>Sonnets to Orpheus</em>, ’’Ibis is the Creature&rdquo;) reflects the central concern of both Rilke’s life and art: the achievement of &ldquo;being,” which this most spiritual yet least doctrinaire of modern German poets defined as &ldquo;the experiencing of the completest possible inner intensity.’’ The eighty-four poems included in this small volume will serve as a sound and inviting introduction to Rilke’s strategies in the pursuit of &ldquo;being.&rdquo; And just as the unicorn in &ldquo;This Is the Creature&rdquo; has an eternal &ldquo;possibility of being&rdquo; but only becomes visible in the mirror held by a virgin, so can our own possibilities become manifest in the mirror held by the sensitive artist. The poems are chosen from <em>The Book of Hours</em> (1899-1903), <em>The Book of Images</em> (1902 and 1906), <em>New Poems</em> (1907 and 1908), <em>Requiem</em> (1909), <em>Duino Elegies</em> (1923), <em>Sonnets to Orpheus</em> (1923), and the posthumous <em>Poems 1906-26</em>. This selection was made by Professor Theodore Ziolkowski of Princeton University, who drew from the various New Directions volumes of Rilke’s work translated by J. B. Leishman.</p>

<h2 id="slug-eelgrass">_slug: eelgrass</h2>

<p><em>Eelgrass</em>, Joe Ashby Porter’s first novel, takes place on an unnamed island somewhere just offshore the Atlantic coast of our imaginations. The ingredients of this wonder-full story blend together as effortlessly as the cocoa and marijuana in the Alice B. Toklas brownies baked (repeatedly) by Daisy, owner of the old farmhouse that serves as a summer commune for herself and her &ldquo;guests&rdquo;: practical Annabel, guitar-playing Jimbo, puppylike Thuggy, and Carter, the golden boy. Add to the five young people: two beautiful, fay &ldquo;pushers&rdquo; who live in the woods and keep the whole island well supplied with a cornucopia of uppers, downers, hallucinogens, coke, and hash; one wiry widow of a sea captain, the oldest resident on the island, who saves inept sailors like Thuggy and Jimbo from themselves; one misanthropic musician who wants to steal Daisy’s farmhouse; one frantic capitalist, his wife and two little girls (who have a talent for stumbling in on adult activity); and one carnivorous were-creature who lives on the island, unknown to all the others. The result is a dreamy midsummer madness that is at once wistful and hilarious, suspenseful and touchingly innocent; for here, greed, ambition, violence, the confrontations of real life exist but have lost all power to harm. The narrative is simple, direct, lyrical; it produces a powerful nostalgia for what was hoped for in those days before the &ldquo;greening of America&rdquo; withered in the bud. Author Porter comments: &ldquo;I began the novel in 1970 and very quickly it was clear to me that the book would be in part an envoi to the preceding decade. There are kinds and kinds of dreams. <em>Eelgrass</em> is meant to delight and be accessible, it is meant to be sunny and give comfort and hope to as many people as possible. It is meant to let them smile remembering it, like a vision of innocence.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Apocalypse and Other Poems</em> by Nicaragua’s revolutionist poet-priest, Ernesto Cardenal, is the author’s second book, the first of poetry, to be published by New Directions. The editors of this volume, Robert Pring-Mill and Donald D. Walsh, have chosen a representative selection of Cardenal’s shorter protest poems, epigrams, religious, and Amerindian verse. Also included are two of Cardenal’s most impressive longer works: the haunting and melodic elegy, &ldquo;Coplas on the Death of Merton,&rdquo; and the title poem, &ldquo;Apocalypse,&rdquo; in which the theme of an ever-threatening nuclear holocaust is the core of a modern rendering of the Book of Revelations. At Our Lady of Solentiname, his religious community on an island in Lake Nicaragua, living and working in the manner of the early Christians, Father Cardenal embodies what he professes: &ldquo;Now in Latin America, to practice religion is to make revolution.&rdquo; An informative introduction has been contributed by Robert Pring-Mill of Oxford University. The translations are by Thomas Merton, Robert Pring-Mill, Kenneth Rexroth and Mireya Jaimes-Freyre, and Donald D. Walsh, who also translated <em>In Cuba</em>, Cardenal’s assessment of Fidel Castro’s revolutionary society, published by New Directions in 1974.</p>

<h2 id="slug-the-sunday-of-life">_slug: the-sunday-of-life</h2>

<p><em>The Sunday of Life</em> (<em>Le Dimanche de la vie</em>), the late Raymond Queneau’s tenth novel, was first published in French by Gallimard in 1951 and is now appearing for the first time in this country, in a translation by Barbara Wright. Critics are universally agreed that it and the later <em>Zazie dans le métro</em> (1959) show Queneau at his zaniest and most cheerful, and it is not surprising that both these novels have been made into popular and successful films. But as always with Queneau, beneath the apparent absurdities of plot and the bumbling of his rather ordinary characters, there is a precision of structure and purpose that, ironically enough, places the work of this earliest of new-wave novelists squarely in the tradition of the eighteenth-century roman philosophique. In the ingenuous ex-Private Valentin Brû, the central figure in <em>The Sunday of Life</em>, Queneau has created that oddity in modern fiction, the Hegelian naïf. Highly self-conscious yet reasonably satisfied with his lot, imbued with the good humor inherent in the naturally wise, Valentin meets the painful nonsense of life’s adventures with a slightly bewildered detachment. As Barbara Wright so aptly writes: &ldquo;Though <em>The Sunday of Life</em> is set in one of the most traumatic of recent periods––1936-40, the dark years leading up to the Second World War and including the fall of France&hellip; it nevertheless does indeed manage to be one of Queneau’s happiest, sunniest, and most undated novels: it far transcends anything like a mere chronicle of times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>”What else are you going to say about a man whose work you wholeheartedly admire than that he is a good poet?&rdquo; said William Carlos Williams over twenty years ago, introducing one of the thirty volumes of Layton’s poetry to appear in Canada in as many years. <em>The Selected Poems of Irving Layton</em> contains a retrospective of fifty poems with an introduction by the noted critic Hugh Kenner, and is intended to present Layton to an American audience that has been sadly unaware of the &ldquo;poetry explosion&rdquo; in Canada in recent years and his part in it. Eli Mandel, who edited the volume, comments: &ldquo;Out of the large body of his work, this selection seeks to make available in an accessible form poems that will tell why Irving Layton remains one of the most powerful, accomplished, and controversial poets writing in Canada today.&rdquo; Born in Romania in 1912, the infant Izzy Lazarovitch (later Irving Layton) moved with his family to Montreal, where his early experiences of prejudice helped hone his own brand of muscular Judaism to a sharp satirical edge. From the first Layton has deliberately placed himself in the center of controversy: in the 1940s for his advocacy of sexual freedom, later for his pro-Americanism, and more recently for his attempt to reclaim Jesus for the Jews. And in his public appearance, Layton has taken the role of poet as entertainer, risking ridicule for the salvation of his fellow men, a role that is a direct outgrowth of his central poetic principle, &ldquo;Whatever else poetry is freedom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since 1947, when his work first began to appear, Philippe Jaccottet has published six volumes of poetry, two of criticism, three of prose-poetry, and several translations from the German. <em>Seedtime</em> (’_’La Semaison_’’)––the title he has given to his notebook journals written from 1954 through 1967––is an especially good introduction to this leading post-war French author, containing as it does passages in both prose and verse. In explaining the word semaison, Jaccottet has drawn a parallel between his sense of the yearly scattering of seed––the sacredness of the act, the uncertainty of its results––and the sense he has of poetry and the written word. Him, his own description on the jacket of the original French edition (Gallimard, 1971): &ldquo;The despairing happiness of words, the despairing defense of the impossible, everything which contradicts, denies, mimicks or blasts. At each instant it is like the first and last word, the first and last poem, embarrassed, solemn, without probability and without force, stubborn fragility, an enduring fountain; and again, in the evening, its sound against death, flabbiness, stupidity; again, its freshness, its limpidity against drivel. Again, the star out of the scabbard.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Here. Now. Always.</em> is the British poet Edwin Brock’s fifth book to be published in this country in as many years. It is perhaps the most intimate work thus far by this intensely personal and often acerbic writer: a memoir in prose interlaced with elucidating passages of his verse. In short episodic epiphanies, Brock reviews his bitter boyhood, his service in the British navy and on the London police force, the collapse of his first marriage. Brock, who was born in 1927, has said that he spent these early years simply “waiting for something to happen.&rdquo; In truth, his every breath was taken in the endless moment––“Here. Now.

<p><em>Travesty</em> is John Hawkes’s most extreme vision of eroticism and comic terror. In the south of France, an elegant sportscar is speeding through the night, bearing a man, his daughter, and his best friend toward a fatal crash. As he drives, the &ldquo;privileged man&rdquo; justifies, in sustained monologue, his firm persuasion that willed destruction is the ultimate act of the poetic imagination. &ldquo;What I have in mind is an ’accident’ so perfectly contrived that it will be unique, spectacular and instantaneous, a physical counterpart to that vision in which it was in fact conceived.&rdquo; This is the final work in a triad of novels concerned with sex, myth, the imagination, and the absurd. <em>The Blood Oranges</em> (1971) is the acting out of a lyric dream; <em>Death, Sleep &amp; The Traveler</em> (1974) a descent into the depths of psychic darkness to the edge of death; and <em>Travesty</em> (1976) an icily comic portrait of the poet as suicide and murderer. It is one of the most cruelly and brilliantly ironic works to be found in contemporary literature.</p>

In <em>Interviews with William Carlos Williams</em>, Linda Wagner of the English Department, Michigan State University, has assembled Dr. Williams’s most important public statements. The first section, entitled simply &ldquo;Interviews,&rdquo; reproduces in toto three in-depth conversations, revealing Dr. Williams’s humor, vitality, and American-ness, as he discusses his theories of poetic meter and diction, his opinions of such contemporaries as Pound and Eliot, and his view of his own role in shaping the course of modern American poetry. The second section, &ldquo;Dialogues,&rdquo; is arranged alphabetically by subject heading. Here are recorded the poet’s thoughts on topics from &ldquo;Art&rdquo; to &ldquo;Women.&rdquo; The third and final part of Interviews with William Carlos Williams, &ldquo;Memoirs and Miscellany,&rdquo; includes the touching account of a visit to the Williamses by artist Gael Turnbull in 1958. Also reprinted are two of Dr. Williams’s best expositions of his own poetic techniques, &ldquo;The American Idiot&rdquo; and &ldquo;How to Write&rdquo;––essays which appeared in early New Directions anthologies but have been generally unavailable since. This valuable collection of comments &ldquo;for the record&rdquo; is annotated and includes an index.</p>

<p>The first major book of short prose poetry in Spanish, <em>Eagle or Sun?</em> (<em>Aguila o Sol?</em>) exerted an enormous influence on modern Latin American writing. Written in 1949-50 by Nobel Laureate Octavio Paz, <em>Eagle or Sun?</em> has as its mythopoeic &ldquo;place&rdquo; Mexico––a country caught up in its pre-Columbian past, the world of modern imperialism, and an apocalyptic future foretold by the Aztec calendar. Indeed, three personae of the book&ndash;the goddess Itzapaplotl, the prophet clerk, the poet––are manifestations of the threefold aspects of the land. Paz himself explains: <em>&ldquo;Eagle or Sun?</em> is an exploration of Mexico, yes, but at the same time, and above all, it is an exploration of the relations between language and the poet, reality and language, the poet and history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kenneth Rexroth’s <em>One Hundred Poems from the Japanese</em> (1955) proved such an extremely popular book that he put together a sequel. The poems are representative of a large range of classical, medieval, and modern poetry, but the emphasis, as in his companion Chinese collections (1955 and 1970), is on folk songs and love lyrics. And because women have had such an outstanding role in Japanese literature, included here are selections from the work, among others, of the remarkable early twentieth-century poet Yosano Akiko and the more contemporary, deeply sensuous Marichiko. As in the earlier volume, <em>One Hundred More Poems from the Japanese</em> presents the original texts in romaji, the transliteration into the Western alphabet, while the authors’ names are given in traditional calligraphy.</p>

<h2 id="slug-gorf">_slug: gorf</h2>

<p>Readers of Michael McClure’s play <em>Gorf</em> may be reminded of Alfred Jarry’s <em>Ubu Roi</em>, even if dancing TV sets and the &ldquo;Middle American&rdquo; protagonists Mert and Gert bring the surreal effect down to native ground. On another level <em>Gorf</em> is a ritual of regeneration, or, if you like, a kind of spiritualized Hellzapoppin. The &ldquo;murdered&rdquo; Mert and Gert are reborn in the search for their child, the Shitfer, who disintegrated when “hurled through Time and Space&rdquo; is resurrected as his discrete &ldquo;pieces&rdquo; find and recognize their unity. And presiding over all is Gorf himself––the flying purple phallus, the cosmic joke and life principle, &ldquo;Our fantasies,&rdquo; McClure explains, &ldquo;when they are enacted, open infinite doors. A play may help us be what we truly are by showing us the possibilities of action.&rdquo; And John Lion, who conceived and produced the widely acclaimed 1974 Magic Theater production of Gorf in San Francisco, adds in his introduction that &ldquo;man’s capacity for renewal and rebirth is tied to his ability to remain in touch with his child self,&rdquo; With this in mind, Gorf is both a play and play itself––satire and myth, married to frivolity and fable. This edition includes photographs by Ron Scherl from the original stage production.</p>

<p>First published in 1975, and available now as a New Directions Paperbook, George Oppen’s <em>Collected Poems</em> brings together the work of one of our foremost contemporary poets, winner of the 1969 Pulitzer Prize. A member of the Objectivist school that flourished in the 1930s (which also included William Carlos Williams, Charles Reznikoff, Carl Rakosi, and Louis Zukofsky), he was hailed by Ezra Pound as &ldquo;a serious craftsman, a sensibility which is not every man’s sensibility and which has not been got out of any other man’s books.&rdquo; Contained in the present volume are Oppen’s late poems, <em>Myth of the Blaze</em> (1972-1975), as well as all of <em>Discrete Series</em> (1934), <em>The Materials</em> (1962), <em>This in Which</em> (1965), <em>Of Being Numerous</em> (1968), and <em>Seascape: Needle’s Eye</em> (1972).</p>

<h2 id="slug-talking-at-the-boundaries">_slug: talking-at-the-boundaries</h2>

<p>For the last few years the poet and art critic David Antin has been performing spontaneous &ldquo;talk poems,&rdquo; eight of which have been brought together in <em>Talking at the Boundaries</em>. &ldquo;I see my talking pieces,&rdquo; says Antin, &ldquo;as philosophical inquiries to which I try to bring the resources of language, not only my own language, but natural language in its natural setting, or one of its natural settings––talk. I’ve been a poet, critic, linguist, and engineer, and though this knowledge informs the book, it is not the work of a professional, of which there are by now too many that have proved too useless. What kind of a professional was Socrates? <em>Talking at the Boundaries</em>,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;asks questions about life, about art, about the nature of experience and how it is apprehended. All of the pieces in it began––like most talk––as improvisations on particular occasions in particular places. They were recorded and transcribed with more or less modification to make this book. But as an improvisation is not in ’prose,’ which is an image of the authority of ’right thinking’ conveyed primarily through ’right printing’––justified margins, conventional punctuation, and regularized spelling––this book has been printed without recourse to such appeals. I do not recognize my wife’s name by its spelling on a page and write it as I see fit when the occasion arises. In this I console myself that Shakespeare’s father’s name is recorded in eighty-three different spellings and that he himself spelled it four different ways in his own will.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="slug-the-hospital-ship">_slug: the-hospital-ship</h2>

<p>Out of Martin Bax’s appalling vision of contemporary civilization in collapse sails <em>The Hospital Ship</em>. The British author’s first novel is the account of an atomic-powered ark attempting to salvage a &ldquo;remnant&rdquo; from a world whose recent wars have resulted in the total loss of both social and individual stability. At first, skilled medical teams from the ironically named ship, the Hopeful, pick up casualties from what seem to be local incidents. But as the crew treats these victims of mass psychosis––intensely withdrawn men and women, autistic children––all signs point toward a world-wide disaster. Psychiatrist Sir Maximov Flint joins the ship and introduces his own solution––love therapy. His two prize patients are V, a Saigon prostitute, and W, a demoralized Wall Street broker––each a casualty of twentieth-century madness. On shore, the holocaust spreads. Landing parties discover in port after port whole populations of men crucified by quiet, neatly dressed Westerners. Forced to retreat from carnage so vast that the medical team can be of no use, the hospital ship sails on––a tiny, heroic vestige of humanity at the fringes of global catastrophe. Forming an integral part of the story, but also in wry counterpoint to it, are verbatim extracts from medical and financial papers and French accounts of a war-torn Indochina. With sardonic wisdom, Bax allows the scientific, business, and military establishments to indict themselves.</p>

<h2 id="slug-the-wisdom-of-the-early-buddhists">_slug: the-wisdom-of-the-early-buddhists</h2>

<p>The historical Buddha, an inspired religious teacher of northern India in the fifth century B.C., left no books of his own for his followers. His wisdom and sayings, however, were collected by his disciples and came to form the basis of one of the world’s major faiths. Geoffrey Parrinder’s <em>The Wisdom of the Early Buddhists</em> is a selection of traditional instruction drawn from the life of the Buddha himself. The texts used are those of the older Theravada (or Hinayana ) branch of the religion, which prevails today in South-east Asia and Sri Lanka. In Professor Parrinder’s retelling, they give us a marvelously clear picture of this great holy man who alone in our era is held to have achieved complete Enlightenment; of the wandering existence he led and advocated: and those of his main concepts which parallel or differ from the Hindus’ and Jains’. The introduction provides a lucid explanation of the background of Buddhism and describes how its various branches originated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If in every mind burns a flame of the Buddha’s Enlightenment,&rdquo; Christmas Humphreys writes in his foreword to <em>The Wisdom of the Zen Masters</em>, &ldquo;there is nothing to seek and nothing to acquire. We are enlightened, and all the words in the world will not give us what we already have. The man of Zen, therefore, is concerned with one thing only, to become aware of what he already is…&rdquo; The task of the Japanese Zen master has been to guide his pupils in their awakening. The means used vary––from severe physical discipline to the proposition of enigmatic riddles, or koans––but always to the same end, Enlightenment: experiencing the Great Death of the worldly &ldquo;I.&rdquo; Unlike most other formal religions, the Japanese school of Zen Buddhism has no canonized corpus of sacred literature which will reveal the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; to diligent readers. There are, however, numerous collections of anecdotes and aphorisms that may serve to convey the sensibility which underscores the practice of Zen. Drawing on these traditional sources, Dr. Irmgard Schloegl of the Buddhist Society in London has gathered into one short volume a sampling of stories and sayings that are a valuable introduction to the study of Zen.</p>

<h2 id="slug-feasts-of-fear-and-agony">_slug: feasts-of-fear-and-agony</h2>

<p>Paul Van Ostaijen (1896-1928) was one of the leading figures of the modernist vanguard in Holland and Belgium, the restless, almost spasmodic quality of his work giving early shape and direction to the expressionist and dadaist tendencies in the Low Countries after the First World War. <em>Feasts of Fear and Agony</em>, a cycle of nineteen poems, was written in 1918-20, when he was with the Belgian occupation forces in Berlin. Van Ostaijen, himself active in leftwing revolutionary circles in Antwerp as well as the Flemish nationalist movement, was deeply affected by the turmoil in Germany. Indeed, the earliest sections of <em>Feasts of Fear and Agony</em> were written at the time of the Spartacist uprising and reflect his bitter, passionate response to the violence of the time. Other poems evidence Van Ostaijen’s preoccupation with religion and metaphysics and the interpenetration of the sacred and profane. After 1920, when Van Ostaijen had arranged the individual poems of <em>Feasts of Fear and Agony</em> into a cohesive whole, he copied them out by hand in an exercise of calligraphic experimentation. For commercial reasons, however, the work was never published in this form during his lifetime. In this its first rendering into English from the original Flemish, samples of Van Ostaijen’s calligraphy, reproduced in facsimile, accompany the opening lines of each poem.</p>

<p>Eugenio Montale’s New Poems—a selection in English translation from Satura (1971) and Diaro del ‘71 e del ‘72, the 1975 Nobel Prize-winning author’s most recent collections—represents a new departure in this major poet’s work. After the death of his wife, Mosca, Montale wrote a series of poems, Xenia, inspired by his memory of her, which in terms of technique, style, and language are unique in Italian literature. In addition to Xenia and other poems evoked by the poet’s wife, this volume includes witty, ironical, and satirical pieces in which Montale displays his flair for linguistic innovation as well as his sharp critical intelligence. Through the extraordinary invention, formal as well as substantive, in his latest verse, Montale makes the Italian language perform in poetry in ways it has never done before, thereby demonstrating his right to be considered one of the great originators of twentieth-century poetry. The contents of New Poems were chosen in close collaboration with Montale himself. The translator, G. Singh of The Queen’s University of Belfast, aims at offering as literal a rendering as is compatible with the idiomatic naturalness in English and the rhythmic cadence any good verse translation must have.</p>

<p><em>The Blocked Heart</em> is the fourth collection by the British poet Edwin Brock to be published in the United States. Reading his most recent verse, one becomes increasingly aware that the author’s pervasive wry melancholy is not so much a passive response to the stress of urban life as a compassionate, virile outburst against it. Here we find, in many ways, a maturing synthesis of his earlier work: the candid, often bitter introspection of <em>Invisibility Is the Art of Survival</em> (1972 ), the more meditative, though no less incisive subtlety of <em>The Portraits The Poses</em> (1973), and the acerbic satire of <em>Paroxisms</em> (1974), a volume which includes illustrations by the poet’s wife, Elizabeth. “[His is] the freshest voice from Britain in years,” writes Hayden Carruth. ’’Brock’s sense of the formal tradition is indubitably English, but otherwise unpredictable, because he uses it very personally, amiably, and with great natural tact. His poems look to me like a breakthrough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>“Perhaps the crux of all writing is to find the word that describes what the eye has seen and the mind imagined,” says Josephson Nicholson in <em>Rolling Stone</em>. “Judged on that basis, Michael McClure’s &hellip; most recent books are as good as anything going. Their advantage is Sheer Scope.” In <em>Jaguar Skies</em> McClure reaffirms the biological intelligence, indeed the active principle, at the heart of his own work. As the book demonstrates so clearly, the exuberant resonances of his verse approach cosmic echoings, while the precise patterns mirror the intricate pulsations of molecules and stars. For McClure, “ecology” is not an ideal but the unalterable fact of all existence: it is how the universe breathes.</p>

<p>Of the full-length prose works that Thomas Merton wrote before he entered the Cistercian Order in 1941, only <em>My Argument with the Gestapo</em> has survived––perhaps in part because it was a book that Merton never ceased wanting to see in print. Although it first appeared after his death in 1968, he had arranged for its publication, written a foreword for it, and was delighted with the prospect of its at last becoming a part of his published works. <em>My Argument with the Gestapo</em> tells of the adventures of a young man, clearly identified by the name Thomas Merton, who travels from America to Europe to report on the war with Germany from the viewpoint of a poet. He hates the war, yet is driven to come to terms with it. There is a pervading sense of dreamworld or hallucination, heightened by the device of passages written in a macaronic language, invented from multilingual roots, to satirize and parody political propaganda speeches dealing with the war. A work of imagination (Merton did not in fact return to England after the start of World War II in Europe), it nevertheless contains much that is autobiographical and revealing of the young Merton. Most clearly visible are the seeds of his never-forsaken concern with peace and nonviolence and his abhorrence of war. Indeed, his outspoken criticism of Britain at a time when all the emphasis was on ’’the brave little island standing alone&rdquo; foreshadows his devotion to truth as he saw it, no matter what the cost. And students of Merton will find scenes in the book that are straight autobiography, amplifying and perhaps filling in gaps in what later was to be the beginning of Merton’s great literary success, <em>The Seven Storey Mountain</em> (1948).</p>

Invoking him as &ldquo;the intellectual father I would have chosen,&rdquo; Robert Lowell offers a tribute to Ransom that fittingly leads off the anthology. Underscoring its international character are translations of the work of four modern Catalan and three contemporary Japanese poets, and a group of poems by the French-Canadian writer Gatien Lapointe. Also included are the late East German author Johannes Bobrowski’s &ldquo;Mouse Feast,&rdquo; an evocation of Poland’s Jews during World War II, and new work by the British poet Edwin Brock. Among American writers, fiction has been contributed by Walter Abish, J. S.

<p>In the sixty poems that comprise <em>The Freeing of the Dust</em>, Denise Levertov continues to explore the personal and public themes that have threaded through her work in the past several years. The disastrous American involvement in Indochina, relations with family and close friends, are depicted with unique poignancy as she pits the at times terrifying concrete image against her vision of the ideal. Here we have poems that speak out of the direct tragedy of war, the result of Ms. Levertov’s visit to North Vietnam in the fall of 1972, while others reflect the anguish and the exultation of what she has called the “inner/outer experience in America during the 60s and the beginning of the 70s…” The Freeing of the Dust is the tenth book of verse by the woman Kenneth Rexroth has named “the most subtly skillful poet of her generation, the most profound, the most modest, the most moving.”</p>

By the time of his death in 1811 at the age of thirty-four — he made a suicide pact with a woman he barely knew — his modest output of seven complete plays and eight Novellen, or chronicle narratives, together with such critical essays as &ldquo;About the Marionette Theater,&rdquo; had profoundly transformed German drama and, indeed, the very scope of European literature. Kleist’s influence has continued strongly to this day, and in recent years such tales as &ldquo;Michael Kohlhaas,&rdquo; or masterful plays like <em>The Prince of Homburg</em>, have been viewed as forerunners of the literature of the &ldquo;grotesque&rdquo; and &ldquo;absurd,&rdquo; or existential, even Kafkaesque statements a century ahead of their time. Yet sadly, Kleist is too little known in this country beyond literary and academic circles, a situation which prompted Professor Robert E. Helbling of The University of Utah to write <em>Heinrich von Kleist: The Major Works</em>, the first comprehensive study of its kind in English. Taking a middle stance between contemporary psychological tendency of German criticism. Helbling’s trenchant insights are aimed at making Kleist more accessible to the student of German literature and the general reader alike. To this end, all his analyses contain synopses of the dramas and Novellen under discussion, while the book begins with a brief biographical sketch. Thoroughly indexed, Helbling’s groundbreaking work also includes notes and an exhaustive bibliography.</p>

<h2 id="slug-lyrics-for-the-bride-of-god">_slug: lyrics-for-the-bride-of-god</h2>

<p>Nathaniel Tarn’s <em>Lyrics for the Bride of God</em>, a book-length poem composed over the course of five years, represents the author’s most sustained effort since <em>The Beautiful Contradictions</em> (1969). The Bride, first appearing at the end of that volume, here dominates the entire work in fulfilling her ultimate kabbalistic task: the return of the holy sparks, dispersed among mankind at the creation, to their original Source. In this, the Bride undergoes exile in the guise of a very human woman––constantly changing identity, species, race, color, age, and even sex; ranging through many different mythical and historical settings; raising a host of political issues from ecology to feminism: and creating, against Tarn’s anthropological background, an astonishing cosmos propelled by the eternal interaction of male and female. Perhaps the author’s most dramatic work, the <em>Lyrics</em> reflect a time of personal tension and loss, a time of exile from Europe transformed into a fervent adoption, on a continental scale, of his new American milieu. Overall, it is Tarn’s expansive, energetic woridview that makes the work cohere. At a time when so much poetry lacks either head or heart, Tarn clearly hopes that, in the <em>Lyrics</em>, both have full sway.</p>

<h2 id="slug-pavannes-divagations">_slug: pavannes-divagations</h2>

<p>The canon of Ezra Pound would be incomplete without a representative collection in the master’s lighter vein. <em>Pavanes and Divagations</em> seeks to meet this need. Included are Pound’s long essay ’’Indiscretions,’’ one of his rare autobiographical writings, an assortment of facetious verses, his superb translations from the dialogues of Fontenelle, causeries on topics ranging from religion to the mores of moneyed society, as well as a miscellany of editorials, denunciations, and literary masquerades. Pound’s barbed wit is displayed here to its best advantage. But more than a simple diversion, this volume presents an important but neglected aspect of the prime shaper of modern poetry in English.</p>

<p>This collection of poems by the great French poet Paul Eluard (1895-1952), first published clothbound in 1951, is now being reissued as a New Directions Paperbook. Associated in earlier years with Surrealism, Eluard’s unique verbal sensuousness, combined with his controlling feel for basic form and increasing political commitment, carried him far beyond the confines of any one movement. Active in the French Resistance during World War II, he wrote and helped circulate clandestine pamphlets without regard to his own safety. His poems of this period, among his finest, gave welcome comfort to the oppressed throughout occupied France. This volume, however, surveys the whole of Eluard’s lifetime work, with the most important poems selected from each of his many collections. The original French texts appear on facing pages; readers, even those not well acquainted with the language, are urged to read them aloud and so experience the pleasure of their essential music, and indeed, the deep physicality intrinsic to Eluard’s verse.</p>

<h2 id="slug-the-falling-sickness">_slug: the-falling-sickness</h2>

<p><em>The Falling Sickness</em>, Russell Edson’s first collection of short plays, will be welcomed by the extensive and devoted readership he has gathered over the years. His turn to the theater reveals a new dimension in his work, a vein of dramatic satire that makes all the more vivid the nightmarish absurdities which underscore so much in our lives. As in his earlier books of illustrated fables, parables, and prose poems, the scale of events is small, though the decibel level is shatteringly high: in each of the four plays, the bewildering wail of a nuclear family giving vent to its pain. If Edson’s microcosm seems unredeemable, it does after all exist in response to the greater world at large, and like the canvases of an Hieronymus Bosch, reveals the secret madnesses at its heart.</p>

Particular emphasis, however, is given to the articles concerned with ’’Civilisation, Money and History.’’ This section contains such essential texts as the &ldquo;ABC of Economics&rdquo; and &ldquo;What Is Money For?&rdquo; as well as two essays––&rdquo;Gold and Work&rdquo; and ’’A Visiting Card&rdquo;––translated from Pound’s Italian and never before published in English in their entirety. Much space is devoted, too, to Pound’s evaluation of his native America, its history, culture, and economy, and his 1913 essay, ’’Patria Mia,’’ is reprinted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The moment of takeoff was ecstatic… joy. We left the ground — I with Christian mantras and a great sense of destiny, of being at last on my true way after years of waiting and wondering…” With these words, dated October 15, 1968, the late Father Thomas Merton recorded the beginning of his fateful journey to the Orient. His Asian journal is a record of the people he encountered and his impressions of Asian cities and landscapes, and is amply illustrated with photographs he himself took along the way. Merton’s travels led him from Bangkok, through India to Ceylon, and back again to Bangkok for his scheduled talk at a conference of Asian monastic orders. There he unequivocally reaffirmed his Christian vocation. His last journal entry was made on December 8, 1968, two days before his untimely, accidental death. Fully indexed, the book also contains a glossary of Asian religious terms, a preface by the Indian scholar Amiya Chakravarty, a foreword and postscript by Brother Patrick Hart of the Abbey of Gethsemani, as well as several appendixes, among them the text of Merton’s final address.</p>

<p>The miscellany of essays, notes, fragments, and jottings to which William Carlos Williams gave the title <em>The Embodiment of Knowledge</em> was found in manuscript after his death in the archive of his papers at the Beinecke Library at Yale University. Written in 1928-30, and dedicated to his sons, it was intended as a concrete demonstration of the organic nature of education, to show that knowledge is an ongoing process by which we create our selves from day to day. And to underscore the fact that so many of his own books were extended works of self-exploration, Dr. Williams wrote on the cover of his manuscript: &ldquo;to be printed as it is, faults and all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fabulous beauty of Helen of Troy is legendary. But some say that Helen was never in Troy, that she had been conveyed by Zeus to Egypt, and that Greeks and Trojans alike fought for an illusion. A fifty-line fragment by the poet Stesichorus of Sicily (c. 640-555 B.C.), what survives of his Pallinode, tells us almost all we know of this other Helen, and from it H. D. wove her book-length poem. Yet <em>Helen in Egypt</em> is not a simple retelling of the Egyptian legend but a recreation of the many myths surrounding Helen, Paris, Achilles, Theseus, and other figures of Greek tradition, fused with the mysteries of Egyptian hermeticism.</p>

Related to his poetry and translations are the innovative anthologies that Rothenberg has edited as part of ’’an on-going attempt to reinterpret the poetic past from the point of view of the present,&rdquo; including <em>Technicians of the Sacred: A Range of Poetries from Africa, America, Asia &amp; Oceana</em> (Doubleday) and, with George Quasha, <em>America a Prophecy: A New Reading of American Poetry from Pre-Colombian Times to the Present</em> (Random House).</p>

All, however, share a common vision: a rediscovery of this land and the ways by which we might become natives of the place, ceasing to think and act (after all these centuries) as newcomers and invaders. A tentative cross-fertilization of ecological thought with Buddhist ideas of interpenetration is also suggested, reflecting the poet’s own life with his family and comrades in the foothills of the California Sierras.</p>

<p>Set in rural New England, Frederick Busch’s powerful yet subtle second novel, <em>Manual Labor</em>, explores the collapse and renewal of a contemporary marriage. Phil and Anne Sorenson––both in their own ways emotionally or physically crippled––search for an equilibrium in the rebuilding of an abandoned farmhouse that becomes a paradigm of their lives. Presented by several voices, principally those of the husband and wife, the novel is rooted in the American gothic tradition of Melville and Hawthorne. Having come in a circle to the East, to the coast of Maine, the Soresons’ journey suggests that of early American settlers who came at last to the sea. Of ultimate importance, however, are domestic love and the insistence, finally, upon surviving history without denying it.</p>

<p>Ezra Pound’s book on the French sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska was first published in 1916. An enlarged edition, including thirty pages of illustrations (sculpture and drawings) as well as Pound’s later pieces on Gaudier, was brought out in 1970, and is now re-issued as an ND Paperbook. The memoir is valuable both for the history of modern art and for what it shows us of Pound himself, his ability to recognize genius in others and then to publicize it effectively. Would there today be a Salle Gaudier-Brzeska in the Musée de L’Art Moderne in Paris if Pound had not championed him? Gaudier’s talent was impressive and his Vorticist aesthetic important as theory, but he was killed in World War I at the age of twenty-three, leaving only a small body of work. Pound knew Gaudier in London, where the young artist had come with his companion, the Polish-born Sophie Brzeska. whose name he added to his own. They were living in poverty when Pound bought Gaudier the stone from which the famous &ldquo;hieratic head&rdquo; of the poet was made. Pound arranged exhibitions and for the publication of Gaudier’s manifestoes in <em>Blast</em> and <em>The Egoist</em>. And he wrote and sent packages to him in the trenches, where Gaudier––a sculptor to the last––carved a madonna and child from the butt of a captured German rifle, just two days before he died.</p>

<h2 id="slug-in-cuba">_slug: in-cuba</h2>

<p>The work of the Nicaraguan poet Ernesto Cardenal is widely read throughout Spanish America today. As a Catholic priest who is also a Marxist revolutionary, his sympathies and understanding span the polarities of popular sentiment, allowing him to view objectively what others, out of ignorance or self-interest, fear. In 1970, eleven years after Fidel Castro’s triumphant Revolution, Cardenal was invited to Havana by the House of the Americas, to sit on the poetry panel of its annual literary competition. Leaving Solentiname, his religious commune, he came to Cuba and remained for several months, keeping voluminous notes on all that he heard and saw. The result was <em>In Cuba</em>, a spontaneous, discursive, and not altogether uncritical account of life in a revolutionary society. Hovering over Cardenal’s whole view of Cuba is the mythic presence of Che Guevara, the martyred revolutionary, and that of the flesh-and-blood Fidel. Appropriately enough, the book culminates in a description of the Cuban premier’s four-hour speech on the 26th of July, and concludes with a private interview with Castro, held the following year. Translated for the first time into English by Donald D. Walsh, this edition includes a helpful glossary and chronology of recent Cuban history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are the poems of a man undergoing a major break fairly late in his years,’’ explains William Everson in his preface to <em>Man-Fate</em>. It is his first collection since leaving the Dominican order in December 1969, and with it the name of Brother Antoninus, by which he was known for twenty years as one of the foremost Catholic poets of our time. The book, he continues, ’’is a love poem sequence, a cycle of renewal, but it also concerns the monastic life, from the point of view of one who has renounced it. The love of woman and the love of solitude have contested together, and solitude has lost.&rdquo; &ldquo;Tendril in the Mesh,’’ the longest poem in <em>Man-Fate</em>, was written while the author was still living the life of a Dominican brother. Because it is the last piece in which he speaks in the persona of a monk, it gives to the entire collection its definitive subtitle: <em>The Swan Song of Brother Antoninus</em>. After the first public reading of “Tendril,’’ Everson tells us, he ’’stripped off his religious habit and fled the platform.&rdquo; The fifteen other poems in the book complete the cycle of reversion from religious to secular life.</p>

<p>Like the author’s <em>Seven Types of Ambiguity</em>, to which it is a successor, <em>Some Versions of Pastoral</em> is considered a landmark of modern literary criticism. In it Mr. Empson sees the pastoral convention as including not only poems of shepherd life but any work &ldquo;about the people but not by or for&rdquo; them. Finding examples in the writing of every country and century, from Mencius to William Faulkner or Céline, he concentrates on an analysis of certain works and forms in English literature, several of them, like Alice in Wonderland, Troilus and Cressida, and proletarian novels not traditionally considered pastoral. His chapter on Milton and Bentley is a precursor of Mr. Empson’s 1961 book, <em>Milton’s God</em>. With virtuoso clarity and perception throughout he brings the student to a new awareness of hidden values in individual works and to the creative possibilities of the language.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In his poetry,&rdquo; writes critic Morgan Gibson of Kenneth Rexroth, &ldquo;he attains––not by ego or will, but through the grace of imagination––communion with nature and those he loves; and, in a transcendent community of love, he discovers himself as being responsible for all.&rdquo; This sense of what is universal, his prophetic embrace of all being and beings, is the moving spirit in <em>New Poems</em>, Rexroth’s first major collection since <em>Love and the Turning Year: One Hundred More Poems from the Chinese</em> (1970). These ninety-one pieces––original poems, adaptations, and translations––include much previously unpublished work, as well as <em>Sky Sea Birds Trees Earth House Beasts Flowers</em>, brought out in a limited edition by Unicorn Press. Rendered from the Chinese, some in collaboration with Ling Chung, are poems from the classic writers and three by Rexroth himself. Translations from the Japanese focus on the short, sensual poems of the contemporary woman poet Marichiko, who takes her pen name from Marichi, the Hindu goddess of the dawn. <em>New Poems</em> is but the latest display of the broad, striking range of Rexroth’s poetic powers.</p>

<p>Henry Miller has called <em>The Smile at the Foot of the Ladder</em> his “most singular story.” First published in 1959, this touching fable tells of Auguste, a famous clown who could make people laugh but who sought to impart to his audiences a lasting joy. Originally inspired by a series of circus and clown drawings by the cubist painter Fernand Léger, Miller eventually used his own decorations to accompany the text in their stead. “Undoubtedly,” he says in his explanatory epilogue, “it is the strangest story I have yet written…No, more even than all the stories which I based on fact and experience is this one the truth. My whole aim in writing has been to tell the truth, as I know it. Heretofore all my characters have been real, taken from life, my own life. Auguste is unique in that he came from the blue. But what is this blue which surrounds and envelopes us if not reality itself?&hellip; We have only to open our eyes and hearts, to become one with that which is.”</p>

<p>Since 1936, the New Directions in Prose and Poetry anthologies have served as vehicles for the presentation of new and variant trends in world literature. The twenty-eighth number in the series, which draws on authors from five different countries, places a special emphasis on prose––narrative, dramatic, and impressionistic; a relatively small but choice selection of poetry is included as well. Walter Abish’s entertaining fiction “Minds Meet&rdquo; leads off the collection. Following it are: &ldquo;Kayanerenhkowa,&rdquo; an excerpt from the Nicaraguan poet Ernesto Cardenal’s celebrated Homage to the American Indians: a brooding autobiographical novella, &ldquo;Cog-wheels,&rdquo; by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, the pioneer of modern Japanese literature who wrote &ldquo;Rashomon&rdquo;; new work by the Objectivist poet Carl Rakosi; &ldquo;Brain Cell 9,999,999,999,&rdquo; a short story by Paul West; three poems by Roberto Sanesi (Italy); James Purdy’s arresting one-act play, &ldquo;Wedding Finger&rdquo;; groups of prose sketches by Frederick Morgan and Faye Sobkowsky; &ldquo;Tendril in the Mesh,&rdquo; a love poem by William Everson (Brother Antoninus); a short story, &ldquo;Growth,&rdquo; by Frederick Busch; Jerome Rothenberg’s &ldquo;A Book of Histories,&rdquo; a section of his work-in-progress, Poland; a short fiction by Coleman Dowell; and a selection of verse by Angel González (Spain).</p>

<p>Readers of the New Directions anthologies will have some familiarity with the work of Coleman Dowell, three of whose remarkable short stories were published in <em>ND26</em>, <em>27</em>, and <em>28</em>. But with the publication of his second novel, Mrs. October Was Here, the vast range of his talents and imagination is strikingly underscored. The action of Dowell’s satirical American fantasy––like some of our dreams, both comic and frightening––takes place &ldquo;out beyond the limits of the twentieth century,&rdquo; in &ldquo;an outpost called Tasmania, Ohio.&rdquo; Lying &ldquo;like an English pudding, rather heavily in its basin,&rdquo; Tasmania is a seat of insularity, bigotry, and boredom harboring its portion of madness and peacefulness, fostered by familiarity. On this, the quintessential American town (“Oh, beautiful for specious skies / For ambient waves of pain&hellip;&ldquo;), Mrs. Septimus October, a lady of vast wealth whose hobby is revolution, descends with her mysterious entourage to stage her great experiment-one aimed at ridding the world of hatred by focusing it on one single individual and destroying him. Her strange cadre of agents grows amid surprising, even sinister circumstances. Mrs. October’s bright and terrible revolution, however, takes a turn she had not anticipated, and the novel reveals itself as a ferocious, many-leveled fable.</p>

<h2 id="slug-tongues-of-fallen-angels">_slug: tongues-of-fallen-angels</h2>

<p>Selden Rodman’s <em>Tongues of Fallen Angels</em> is a collection of conversations with twelve ranking authors, leading men of letters in the Western Hemisphere, with accompanying informal photographs. From Spanish America: Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel Garcia Márquez, the late Pablo Neruda, and Octavio Paz. From Brazil: Vinicius de Moraes and Joan Cabral de Melo Neto. From Trinidad: the poet-playwright Derek Walcott. From the United States: Robert Frost, Allen Ginsberg. Ernest Hemingway, Stanley Kunitz, and Norman Mailer. An impressive list, and all the more so given Rodman’s remarkable power to give human substance to figures whose everyday words have been generally ignored in favor of their writings and other public pronouncements. When Rodman’s <em>Conversations With Artists</em> appeared in 1957, it aroused a storm of controversy, intentionally polemical, it became a storm center in the battles then raging in the art world. Rodman’s journals also contained records of fiery bouts with novelists and poets of stature. He was urged at the time to publish them, but refrained, preferring to wait for a book of a different, more empathic intent, in putting together <em>Tongues of Fallen Angels</em>, Rodman––the editor of such seminal anthologies as <em>One Hundred British Poets</em> and _One Hundred American Poems_––forcefully asserts the essential social role of the creator. ’’The minor poet,&rdquo; he declares, ’’is primarily concerned with form or innovation; the major one uses these tools almost unconsciously to say something he feels he has to say––and which the world will be better for hearing.&rdquo;</p>

While the &ldquo;geoglyphic&rdquo; African landscape forms and crumbles, it is, among other things, attacked by an army of driver ants, invaded by Zanzibar, painted orange by the transvestite Queen Quat of Tanzania, and becomes a hunting ground for a pair of murderous jewel thieves tracking down their nymphomaniac moll. </p>

<p>“Poetry and theatre are organisms and biological extensions of the artist,” says Michael McClure. “My unusual line and shape of poems is a feedback between poems as living beings and knowledge of traditional shapes. I believe in inspiration. I am especially fond of wild flowers, mastodons, and stars.” In <em>September Blackberries</em>, a collection of seventy-five of his recent poems, McClure demonstrates this “bio-alchemical” aesthetic with his usual prodigious verbal energy. Readers familiar with the work of the Beat Generation and the San Francisco Renaissance will recognize at once, in such long sequences as “The Skull,” “Xes,” and “We,” the poet’s characteristic typographic display, the breath-line that verges on the primal scream.</p>

<p>This representative collection of works by the late Elio Vittorini (1908-1966) brings under a single cover three short novels. <em>The Twilight of the Elephant</em> (<em>II Sempione strizza l’occhio al Fréjus</em>, 1946) is a haunting, mythlike tale bearing strong affinities with music and abstract art. It is the story of a poverty-stricken family and its extraordinary grandfather––a veritable &ldquo;elephant&rdquo; of a man. One of the recognized classics of modern literature, <em>In Sicily</em> (<em>Conversazione in Sicilia</em>, 1937) recounts a city man’s rediscovery of himself and the basic values of life when he returns for a visit to the primitive Sicilian village where he was born. Included in this edition is an introduction written in 1949 by Ernest Hemingway, who greatly admired Vittorini. The third novella, <em>La Garibaldina</em> (1950), is a vivid portrait of an eccentric old woman, a former camp follower of Garibaldi’s army, and her encounter with a young soldier on a night-train journey across Sicily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The growth of the work of Octavio Paz,&rdquo; writes Muriel Rukeyser in her preface to this bilingual selection of the Mexican poet’s <em>Early Poems</em>, &ldquo;has made clear to an audience in many languages what was evident from the beginning &hellip; he is a great poet, a world-poet whom we need. The poems here speak––as does all his work since––deeply, erotically, with grave and passionate involvement.&rdquo; In this, a much revised edition of the earlier <em>Selected Poems</em> (Indiana University Press, 1963), Miss Rukeyser has joined to her own translations those of Paul Blackburn, Lysander Kemp, Denise Levertov, and William Carlos Williams, while many of the readings embody Paz’s own revisions of the original texts. The poems were chosen from eight separate collections, among them <em>Condición de nube</em> (&ldquo;Phase of Cloud&rdquo;), <em>Semillas para un himno</em> (&ldquo;Seeds for a Psalm&rdquo;), <em>Piedras sueltas</em> (&ldquo;Riprap&rdquo;), and <em>Estación violenta</em> (&ldquo;Violent Season&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Called by some the French Borges, by others the creator of le nouveau roman a generation ahead of its time, Raymond Queneau’s work in fiction continues to defy strict categorization. <em>The Flight of Icarus</em> (<em>Le Vol d’lcare</em>) is his only novel written in the form of a play: seventy-four short scenes, complete with stage directions. Consciously parodying Pirandello and Robbe-Grillet, it begins with a novelist’s discovery that his principal character, Icarus by name, has vanished. This, in turn, sets off a rash of other such disappearances. Before long, a number of desperate authors are found in search of their fugitive characters, who wander through the Paris of the 1890s, occasionally meeting one another, and even straying into new novels. Icarus himself — perhaps following the destiny his name suggests — develops a passion for horseless carriages, kites, and machines that fly. And throughout the almost vaudevillian turns of the plot, we are aware, as always, of Queneau’s evident delight at holding the thin line between farce and philosophy.</p>

<p>It is poems such as these, among those of other poets roughly associated with the San Francisco school, which Pablo Neruda had in mind when he spoke with Ferlinghetti in Cuba not so long ago of “your wide-open American poetry.” There is a wide-angle vision and a very great range in the different kinds and genres of poems––personal and lyric, satiric and meditative, public and political, spoken and sung––written over the past decade during the poet’s travels in the world and inside himself––a world seen in a semi-dark glass through which light nevertheless keeps breaking. In the political section, Ferlinghetti’s consistent anarchist-pacifist position, in the tradition of Kenneth Rexroth and Kenneth Patchen, is articulated, showing the poet to be a constant force in the evolution of a radical humanist consciousness.</p>

<p>Walter Sutton’s <em>American Free Verse</em>, unlike the more usual general discussions of American poetry, concentrates on the origins and growth of the modern free verse movement. In the words of the author, who is Professor of the Humanities at Syracuse University, the book offers &ldquo;testimony to the vitality and imaginative resourcefulness of American poetry.&rdquo; The title, however, does not imply an exclusive preoccupation with form, since it also refers to the historical aspects of a still-developing tradition. Opening with a preparatory consideration of Romanticism, Sutton focuses full attention on Walt Whitman, and touches briefly on the work of Emily Dickinson and Stephen Crane. He turns next to the early years of the twentieth century, a watershed period in the arts that saw the establishment of free verse as the dominant poetic mode. Of the first generation of modernists, Sutton devotes two chapters apiece to Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams, who ’’took upon themselves in a period of great disillusionment the role of epic spokesmen in the tradition of Whitman,&rdquo; and gives special attention as well to E. E. Cummings and Marianne Moore. The author then considers &ldquo;The Conservative Counterrevolution’’ of the New Critics and the &ldquo;Middle Generation.&rdquo; And finally, with &ldquo;The Revolution Renewed,&rdquo; he brings his discussion around to a wide-ranging appreciation of the &ldquo;Third Generation&rdquo;: Charles Olson’s &ldquo;projective verse&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Beat&rdquo; movement, concretism and the poetry, among others, of Robert Creeley, Robert Duncan. Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Denise Levertov, Thomas Merton, Gary Snyder, and Kenneth Rexroth.</p>

<p>The larger part of this classic symposium on the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins was originally assembled as a special number of <em>The Kenyon Review</em> to celebrate in 1944 the centenary of the poet’s birth, and then published in the New Directions &ldquo;Makers of Modern Literature&rdquo; series. Austin Warren contributes a biographical sketch and a study of Hopkins’s debt to traditional verse forms. Marshall McLuhan explores the ideas behind the poet’s symbols and images. Harold Whitehall analyzes his famous &ldquo;sprung rhythm,&rdquo; Josephine Miles the characteristics of his idiom. Robert Lowell emphasizes his religious nature, Arthur Mizener his Victorian heritage. And F. R. Leavis discusses the metaphysical character of his poems.</p>

<h2 id="slug-no-longer-human">_slug: no-longer-human</h2>

<p>Portraying himself as a failure, the protagonist of Osamu Dazai’s <em>No Longer Human</em> narrates a seemingly normal life even while he feels himself incapable of understanding human beings. Oba Yozo’s attempts to reconcile himself to the world around him begin in early childhood, continue through high school, where he becomes a ’clown&rdquo; to mask his alienation, and eventually lead to a failed suicide attempt as an adult. Without sentimentality, he records the casual cruelties of life and its fleeting moments of human connection and tenderness. Semi-autobiographical, <em>No Longer Human</em> is the final completed work of one of Japan’s most important writers, Osamu Dazai (1909-1948). The novel has come to &ldquo;echo the sentiments of youth&rdquo; (Hiroshi Ando, <em>The Mainichi Daily News</em>) from post-war Japan to the postmodern society of technology. Still one of the ten bestselling books in Japan, <em>No Longer Human</em> is a powerful exploration of an individual’s alienation from society.</p>

<p>Speaking of his own work, Robert Duncan (1919-1987) said: &ldquo;I make poetry as other men make war or make love or make states or revolutions: to exercise my faculties at large.&rdquo; <em>The Opening of the Field</em>, his first major collection, was originally brought out in 1960; in it, Duncan introduced his &ldquo;Structures of Rime,&rdquo; the open series he continued in his subsequent collections, <em>Roots and Branches</em> (1964) and <em>Bending the Bow</em> (1968), <em>Ground Work: Before the War</em> (1983), and <em>Ground Work II: In the Dark</em> (1987). &ldquo;Structures of Rime&rdquo; affirms his belief in the universal integrity of the poem itself in the living process of language. Thus in &ldquo;The Structure of Rime I&rdquo; he declares: &ldquo;O Lasting Sentence, / sentence after sentence I make in your image. In the feet that measure the dance of my pages I hear cosmic intoxications of the man I will be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An early version of Elio Vittorini’s <em>Women of Messina</em> was published in Italian in 1950 and, by the author’s request, never reprinted. After considerable restructuring and rewriting, a second, definitive edition was brought out fourteen years later; it is this novel—Vittorini’s last—which is now appearing fro the first time in English translation. Readers familiar with Vittorini’s work will find Women of Messina remarkably suggestive in both spirit and content of his memorable In Sicily (1937). Once more, the theme is the search for certainty in the face of massive apathy and hopelessness. Consciously evoking Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, Vittorini recounts the attempts of metaphorically ’shipwrecked&rdquo; group of men and women—most, like him, natives of Sicily—to construct a new life on the site of a devastated village in postwar Italy. A lyrical work of epic scope—termed a &ldquo;choral narrative&rdquo; by the novelist Italo Calvino—Women of Messina bears witness to the human will to survive with dignity.</p>

<h2 id="slug-in-the-future-perfect">_slug: in-the-future-perfect</h2>

<p><em>In the Future Perfect</em> is Walter Abish’s third collection of fiction. Readers of his earlier prose works––<em>Minds Meet</em> and the novel _Alphabetical Africa_––will recognize the dead-pan humor that subverts familiar realities by reflecting on the nature of language itself rather than plot or narrative voice and line. With this ironic introduction of the unexpected, society’s most comfortable symbols––the icon of the model city, for example, or the sanctuary of the perfect home––come to delineate the very precariousness of our existence. In one of the nine stories included here, an American on his first trip abroad interviews a postwar German writer in a new town built on the site of a former concentration camp. In another, a successful woman executive, between elegant parties, swings with leather-jacketed motorcycle thugs in her impeccable Central Park West apartment. One of the leading lights in experimental letters in America, Walter Abish writes fiction that reflects on its own structure and confronts its characters with the preposterousness of their condition. &ldquo;Is there any other way to live?&rdquo; was the question reiterated in <em>Minds Meet.</em> To which the answer remains: &ldquo;There is not, but we try.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Our Examination Round His Factifiation for Incamination of Work in Progress</em> is unique among the many books Finnegans Wake has evoked from other writers. This symposium was published in Paris ten years before Joyce’s <em>Finnegans Wake</em> was completed. The contributors were all friends or acquaintances of the author: Samuel Beckett, Marcel Brion, Frank Budgen, Stuart Gilbert, Eugene Jolas, Victor Llona, Robert McAlmon, Thomas McGreevy, Elliot Paul, John Rodker, Robert Sage and William Carlos Williams. There are also ’Letters of Protest’ from G. V. L. Slingsby and Vladimir Dixon. Prepared in such circumstances, with the active encouragement of James Joyce, the book could only have appeared under one imprint, that of Shakespeare and Company, publishers of Ulysses. This edition also includes the characteristic introduction by Miss Sylvia Beach, the original publisher.</p>

<p>H. D.’s (Hilda Doolittle, 1884-1961) late poems of search and longing represent the mature achievement of a poet who has come increasingly to be recognized as one of the most important of her generation. The title poem and other long pieces in this collection (&ldquo;Sagesse&rdquo; and &ldquo;Winter Love&rdquo;) were written between 1957 and her death four years later, and are heretofore unpublished, except in fragments. We can see now in proper context her fine ear for the free line, and understand why other poets, such as Denise Levertov, Robert Creeley, and Robert Duncan, find so much to admire in H. D.’s work. As in her earlier books, one level of H.D.’s significant poetic statement derives from her intimate knowledge of and identification with classical Greek and arcane cultures; taken together, these elements make up the poet’s own personal myth. Norman Holmes Pearson, H. D’s friend and literary executor, has contributed an illuminating foreword to this impressive collection.</p>

<p><em>Invisibility Is the Art of Survival</em> marks the first appearance in this country, in book form, of the work of Edwin Brock. Born in London in 1927, Brock says he has spent the subsequent years waiting for something to happen, occupying his time as a sailor, journalist, policeman, and adman, in that order. Yet none of this, he feels, has touched him, &ldquo;except with a fine patina of invisibility.&rdquo; Poetry, however, is for him an act of self-definition &ldquo;which sometimes goes so deep that you become what you have defined. And this,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;is the nearest thing to an activity I have yet found.&rdquo; Thus in addition to being poetry editor of <em>Ambit</em>, Brock has published several volumes of his own. His first, <em>An Attempt at Exorcism</em>, was brought out in 1959, and was followed over the next decade by <em>A Family Affair</em>, <em>With Love from Judas</em>, a large selection in <em>Penguin Modern Poets 8</em>, and <em>A Cold Day at the Zoo</em>. For <em>Invisibility Is the Art of Survival</em>, Brock has gleaned a representative selection from all his previous books, adding to it a number of recent, uncollected poems. Confronted with his work, American readers will agree with the critic Alan Pryce-Jones that Brock has written &ldquo;some of the most observant and compassionate poems of our time––poems, moreover, in which the poet keeps his feet on the ground as skillfully as his head in the air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many regard the work of Saint John of the Cross (1542-91), the 16th century mystic, to be among the finest poetry Spain has produced. Most of these poems were written during a period of nine months, in 1577–78, when Saint John (San Juan de la Cruz) was imprisoned and tortured in the dungeon of a small Carmelite monastery in Toledo, and their recurrant motifs are both metaphysical and deeply personal. Saint John’s poetry of love and joy describes the soul’s passage through dark night to final illumination in mystical union with Absolute Being. The allegory the poet uses is that of earthly love, and the poems are strikingly effective on the immediate level of personal experience, quite apart from their theological meanings. In this they resemble the Old Testament &ldquo;Song of Songs,&rdquo; the source of Saint John’s most ambitious poem, &ldquo;Cántico espiritual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since 1936, the New Directions anthologies have served as vehicles for the presentation of new and variant literary trends. The twenty-fifth in the series––in a sense, an ’anniversary’’ number––is dedicated to the late Kenneth Patchen (1911-1972), and contains Lawrence Ferlinglietti’s moving &ldquo;Elegy&rdquo; in the memory of a man whose intimate association with the New Directions house spanned the course of nearly four decades. Gary Snyder’s trenchant ecological statement, “’Energy Is Eternal Delight,’” leads oil the collection, and is followed by a wide range of contributions drawn from eight different countries. Austria: the poetry of Peter Handke. Brazil: stories by Osman Lins and Glance Lispector. England: poems by Edwin Brock. Estonia: ’’Dry Radiance,’’ the first major appearance, in English, of the poetry of Aleksis Rannit. France: a graphic display of ’’Petites Sculptures&rdquo; by the concrete poet J.F. Bory.

<p>Sartre’s study of Baudelaire is one of the more brilliant achievements of modern criticism. We may often disagree with his interpretations of the poet’s personality, but we cannot fail to wonder at the mastery with which he presents his case. It is the case, quite patently, of an Existentialist who wishes to psychoanalyze a paramount literary figure in terms of his own beliefs. Perhaps Sartre’s greatest contribution to Existentialism has been his own personality. He made it a living philosophy, giving it his exotic imagination, his penchant for controversy, and above all his daring. He turned abstractions like Existence and Being, Freedom and Nature, into a theory of psychoanalysis, grounded in man’s creativity and opposed to Freudian determinism. Then he put the theory into practice in this book on Baudelaire. Baudelaire: man of shadows, opium-addict, dandy, frigid disciple of volupté; and then the greatest lyric poet of the age. Sartre lays bare the “lunar landscape of this distressed soul.&rdquo; We see Baudelaire, with anguished intelligence, selecting and arranging his own evil destiny, juggling the values of a world at the turning point of modern times.</p>

<p>Throughout four consecutive decades, New Directions in Prose and Poetry has been at the very core of the ND list. Each volume, in essence a literary magazine in book form and international in character, has presented year after year the work of writers who have sought to extend the frontiers of method and content. This latest number, the twenty-fourth, draws on authors from seven different nations to produce a broad spectrum of prose, poetry, and drama. Among its highlights are Edouard Roditi’s &ldquo;The Vampires of Istanbul,&rdquo; an amusing satire of epistolatory feuds: Jürgen Becker’s Margins, a complete &ldquo;Text&rdquo; by one of West Germany’s most influential avant-garde writers; &ldquo;Nine Poems&rdquo; by Attila József, a selection representing a chronology in brief of the pre-World War II Hungarian poet’s work; and &ldquo;Four Poems&rdquo; by Elio Pagliarani, a leading Italian poet associated with the experimental &ldquo;Gruppo 63.&rdquo; Included, too, are stories by Alain Arias-Misson, E. M. Beckman, Benjamin Haimowitz, Yumiko Kurahashi (Japan), Jay Peter Olwyler, Nancy Willard, and William Witherup; poems by Douglas Blazek, Carlos Bousoño (Spain), Peter Glassgold, Daniel Halpern, James Purdy, Aleksis Rannit (Estonia), John Ratti, and John Taggart; a verse play by Edwin Honig; and a short drama by Junichiro Tanizaki (Japan).</p>

Once again, the Annual is international: Stephen Stepanchev has translated a group of poems by the Yugoslavian poet Vasko Popa; Samuel Grolmes and Yumiko Tsumura present the Japanese poet Ryuichi Tamura; Dennis Silk (Israel) blends parody and fantasy in the prose &ldquo;journey,&rdquo; Montefiore; there is a scene from the play Sunday They’ll Make Me a Saint by the Greek-American writer Demetrius Toteras; and from Britain we have Stuart Montgomery’s verse sequence, Circe, a section of photographs of the concrete poetry of Ian Hamilton Finlay (Scotland) and a group of drawings by the poet Charles Tomlinson. Three of the young American poets in ND22 are active in the Black movement: Ed Roberson, Quincy Troupe and Al Young. Richard Meyers is a promising discovery, and we welcome Robert Lowry again with a fine poem.

<p><em>Emergency Poems</em> is the Chilean poet Nicanor Parra’s second bilingual collection published by New Directions. The spare, often grim irony of the first <em>Poems and Antipoems</em> (1967)—a wide selection gleaned from his four earliest books—established his reputation with a North American reading public used to the more formal language of conventional Spanish-speaking poets. Since then he has traveled extensively in this country, teaching, lecturing, and reading from his own work; while in Chile he received the 1969 Premio Nacional de Literatura (National Literature Prize) for his <em>Obra Gruesa</em>, from which many of the pieces in <em>Emergency Poems</em> are drawn. In his introduction to this latest collection, Miller Williams, the translator, comments that Parra’s &ldquo;poetry has moved and expanded as the imagination behind it has since the publication of <em>Poems and Antipoems</em>. Those who are familiar with Parra’s work will find the humor more sharply honed and darker, the anger closer to the surface and sometimes breaking through, the language tighter, the compassion deeper and the statements more political—or anyway more social.&rdquo;</p>

Amusing, satirical and witty, Williams has yet been called &ldquo;the most lyrical of young poets&rdquo;––evidence of the great range of mood and style at which he excels. Also varying, from the academic all the way to the ironic, are the elaborate notes appended to the poems in this volume. The title of the collection celebrates the early American naturalist William Bartram’s discovery of that rarest of native trees, Franklinia Alatamaha, which has not been seen in the wild since 1803.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Need I insist that the only enemy of the mature marriage is monogamy? That anything less than sexual multiplicity is … naïve? That our sexual selves are merely idylers in a vast wood?&rdquo; Thus the central theme of John Hawkes’s widely acclaimed novel <em>The Blood Oranges</em> is boldly asserted by its narrator, Cyril, the archetypal multisexualist. Likening himself to a white bull on Love’s tapestry, he pursues his romantic vision in a primitive Mediterranean landscape. There two couples––Cyril and Fiona, Hugh and Catherine––mingle their loves in an &ldquo;Illyria&rdquo; that brings to mind the equally timeless countryside of Shakespeare’s <em>Twelfth Night</em>. Yet no synopsis or comparison can convey the novel’s lyric comedy or, indeed, its sinister power––sinister because of the strength of will Cyril exerts over his wife, his mistress, his wife’s reluctant lover; lyric, since he is also a &ldquo;sex-singer&rdquo; in the land where music is the food of love.</p>

<h2 id="slug-jean-racine">_slug: jean-racine</h2>

<p>&ldquo;This is a book about dramatic experience,&rdquo; declares Martin Turnell in his introduction to this, the latest in his distinguished series of studies in French literature. The author of <em>The Art of French Fiction</em>, <em>Baudelaire: A Stusy of his Poetry</em>, <em>The Classical Moment</em>, and <em>The Novel in France</em> now turns to the work of Jean Racine, insisting that the true test of France’s greatest tragic playwright remains the continuing effectiveness of the theatre itself. For above all, &ldquo;the plays must be studied as dramatic and not literary works. Racine’s tragedies are pure drama in the sense in which we are accustomed to speaking of ’pure poetry.’&rdquo; Beginning with a general &ldquo;Approach to Racine,&rdquo; Turnell next considers each of the eleven plays, emphasizing their distinctive features, analyzing their structures, and pointing up the relevance of subject matter—the preoccupation with despotism, for example—for our time. Special attention is given as well to the great tirades, the poetry and imagery, while a final chapter discusses versification and language. Thus, if as Francois Mauriac has suggested, of all French authors Racine has become one of the least accessible, then Turnell’s book surely helps bridge the gap between modern sensibility and the classic world of 17th-century France.</p>

<h2 id="slug-footprints">_slug: footprints</h2>

<p>About two thirds of the poems in Denise Levertov’s <em>Footprints</em> were written concurrently with the long &ldquo;notebook&rdquo; poem that began to take shape in <em>Relearning the Alphabet</em> (1970) and reached full expression in <em>To Stay Alive</em> (1971), to which it lent its name. Most of the remaining material was composed subsequently. Readers familiar with these previous volumes, so emphatically political in theme, will discover a more reflective tone, indeed a note which touches on the mystical, pervading this newest collection. The antiwar motif, however, is by no means lacking. And in such poems as &ldquo;Overheard over S. E. Asia&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Day the Audience Walked Out on Me, and Why&rdquo; the strength of Miss Levertov’s social commitment is, as always, given powerful utterance.</p>

<p><em>Imaginations</em> makes accessible to the broad reading public five early books by William Carlos Williams, which, except for <em>Kora in Hell</em>, have long been hard to find in their original and complete forms. Written between 1920 and 1932, all five were first published in small editions, three of them in France. These are pivotal and seminal works, books in which a great writer was charting the course he later would follow, experimenting freely, boldly searching for a new kind of prose style to express &ldquo;the power of the imagination to hold human beings to life and propel them onward.&rdquo; The prose-poem improvisations (<em>Kora in Hell</em>) &hellip; the interweaving of prose and poetry in alternating passages (<em>Spring and All</em> and <em>The Descent of Winter</em>) &hellip; an antinovel whose subject is the impossibility of writing &ldquo;The Great American Novel&rdquo; in America &hellip; automatic writing (<em>A Novelette</em>) &hellip; these are the challenges which Williams accepted and brilliantly met in his early work.</p>

<p>The lyric poetry of Tu Fu ranks with the greatest in all world literature. Across the centuries––Tu Fu lived in the T’ang Dynasty (713-770)––his poems come through to us with an immediacy that is breathtaking in Kenneth Rexroth’s English versions. They are as simple as they are profound, as delicate as they are powerful. Thirty-five poems by Tu Fu make up the first part of this volume. The translator then moves on to the Sung Dynasty (10th-12th centuries) to give us a number of poets of that period, much of whose work was not previously available in English: Mei Yao Ch’en, Su Tung P’o, Lu Yu, Chu Hsi, Hsu Chao, and the poetesses Li Ch’ing Chao and Chu Shu Chen. There is a general introduction, biographical and explanatory notes on the poets and poems, and a bibliography of other translations of Chinese poetry.</p>

<p>Ezra Pound would deserve a place in the literary history of the twentieth century if only for bringing to light and to publication the work, among others, of T. S. Eliot, Robert Frost, James Joyce and William Carlos Williams. His tireless activities in behalf of other poets, artists, and literary ventures of every sort were in large part carried on by way of his voluminous correspondence. Eliot himself once commented that Pound’s &ldquo;epistolary style is masterly&rdquo;––a judgment wholly confirmed by the 384 examples that comprise this selection. Included here are the poet’s letters to Margaret Anderson of <em>The Little Review</em>, Harriet Monroe of <em>Poetry</em>, Harriet Shaw Weaver of <em>The Egoist</em>, H. L. Mencken and John Quinn; to such poets and writers as E. E. Cummings, Ernest Hemingway, Amy Lowell, Marianne Moore, Eliot, Joyce and, of course, his old friend Dr. Williams. Of exceptional interest, however, is Pound’s massive correspondence with the young unknowns who wrote to him for advice. &ldquo;The tone of his prose criticism,&rdquo; says D. D. Paige in his Introduction, &ldquo;with its coruscations, its ellipses, its dogmatisms, its gay carnival air, its unwillingness to enjoy the safety gravity offers, its violence against entrenched stupidity and its championing of fresh writers––all that simply encouraged them to approach him. A tremendous lure!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The modern novel in its most cogent and permanent form”––this has been the achievement of E. M. Forster; his masterpiece, <em>A Passage to India</em>, belongs with perhaps three or four other works in English at the pinnacle of literary craftsmanship in this century. Yet for many years Forster’s genius was virtually unrecognized in America. Not until 1943, when Lionel Trilling’s authoritative and discerning study was first published, did Forster find his way to a broad American audience. In this 1964 revision of the first paperbook edition, Mr. Trilling added a preface and brought the bibliography up to date. His book performs two services: it is a critical-biographical introduction to the master novelist and his works; it is in itself a primary document in the development of, contemporary American criticism. Here is criticism functioning at its best, deftly, surely, wittily, within a framework of the ideas which are basic to literary thought today.</p>

<h2 id="slug-the-back-country">_slug: the-back-country</h2>

<p>&ldquo;A reaffirmation of a back country of the spirit&rdquo; (<em>Kirkus Reviews</em>), this collection is made up of four sections: &ldquo;Far West&rdquo; — poems of the Western mountain country where, as a young man, Gary Snyder worked as a logger and forest ranger; &ldquo;Far East&rdquo; — poems written between 1956 and 1964 in Japan where he studied Zen at the monastery in Kyoto; &ldquo;Kali&rdquo; — poems inspired by a visit to India and his reading of Indian religious texts, particularly those of Shivaism and Tibetan Buddhism; and &ldquo;Back&rdquo; — poems done on his return to this country in 1964 which look again at our West with the eyes of India and Japan. The book concludes with a group of translations of the Japanese poet Miyazawa Kenji (1896-1933), with whose work Snyder feels a close affinity. The title, <em>The Back Country</em>, has three major associations: wilderness, the &ldquo;backward&rdquo; countries, and the &ldquo;back country&rdquo; of the mind with its levels of being in the unconscious.</p>

<p>Since 1936, the New Directions Annuals have served as vehicles for the presentation of new and variant trends in world literature. The international character of this year’s anthology, the twenty-third in the series, is underscored by translations of substantial works by three major foreign poets––Enrique Lihn (Chile), Fernando Pessoa (Portugal) and Yannis Ritso (Greece).</p>

<p>Of the American poets, some have long-standing reputations, such as Robert Bly, William Bronk, Robert Duncan, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Denise Levertov and Carl Rakosi; others, like Besmilr Brigham, Walter S. Hamady and Richard Meyers, have contributed to recent Annuals: while a number are newcomers of promise––David Giannini, Yuki Hartman and Lawson Fusao Inada. The prose sections exhibit an especially rich diversity of technique, form and subject matter, ranging from Gary Snyder’s essay on ecology, The Wilderness, and Russell Edson’s satirical short play, Ketchup, to an ingenious free-form piece by Don Wulffson, <em>You Too Can Be a Floorwax That Even Your Husband Could Apply</em>. There are, in addition, short stories by Walter Abish, Marvin Cohen and James Purdy, and excerpts from works in progress by Charles Henri Ford and Dennis Silk.</p>

<p>Octavio Paz, the 1990 Nobel Laureate, has won distinction as an anthropologist, philosopher and critic of art and literature. But it is as a poet that he is most celebrated. <em>Configurations</em> was his first major collection to be published in this country, and includes in their entirety <em>Sun Stone</em> (1957) and <em>Blanco</em> (1967). Paz himself translated many of the poems from the Spanish. Some distinguished contributors to this bilingual edition include, among others, Paul Blackburn, Lysander Kemp. Denise Levertov, and Muriel Rukeyser. Paz’s poems, although rooted in the mythology of South America and his native Mexico, nevertheless have an international background, transfiguring the images of the contemporary world. Powerful, angry, erotic, they voice the desires and rage of a generation.</p>

<p>Years ago the English critic and novelist Alex Comfort said of Kenneth Patchen’s work that its impact was so immediate and overwhelming as to render analysis and evaluation of it nearly impossible. That judgment bears up very well—particularly for anyone attempting a description of Wonderings! Here in these pages the extraordinary range and power of Patchen’s imagination, and the virtuosity of his technique, were never more striking—their impact is indeed breathtaking. His new universe is exciting and spirit-cleansing. The light streaming from the hand and heart of this poet-artist illuminates the darkness, the sordid and confused pettiness of our day-to-day existence. Wonderings may defy classification, but we believe it is Kenneth Patchen’s masterpiece in an art form which he originated.</p>

<p>When Guillaume Apollinaire died in 1918 at the age of thirty-eight, as the result of a war wound, he was already known as one of the most original and important poets of his time. He had led the migration of Bohemian Paris across the city from Montmartre to Montparnasse; he had helped formulate the principles of Cubism, having written one of the first books on the subject, and coined the word &ldquo;Surrealist&rdquo;; and he had demonstrated in his own work those innovations we have come to associate with the most vital investigations of the avant-garde. This bilingual, illustrated edition of <em>The Selected Writings of Apollinaire</em>, the only representative collection in English translation, begins with a comprehensive critical Introduction by the translator, Roger Shattuck. The next section is devoted to poetry. Included here are almost half of Apollinaire’s two best-known volumes, <em>Alcools</em> and <em>Calligrammes</em>, as well as a selection from five other books, and the long love poem <em>La Chanson du Mal-Aimé</em> in its entirety. The prose section leads off with &ldquo;L’Esprit Nouveau et les Poetes&rdquo;, a seminal discussion of modern poetry that anticipates such movements as Dada and Futurism. This is followed by Apollinaire’s almost unobtainable &ldquo;Introduction to Baudelaire and Oneirocriticism&rdquo;, an early experimental work composed in a style prophetic of Surrealist automatic writing. There are, in addition, two stories, a passage from Anecdotiques, and a section from the novel <em>Le Poete Assassiné</em>.</p>

<p>Robert Fitzgerald’s work first appeared in <em>Poetry</em> forty years ago. Since then his controlled yet lyric voice, his intimacy with the classic tradition, have gained for him a distinguished reputation as poet and translator. In <em>Spring Shade</em>, he brings together all of his previous collections––<em>Poems</em> (1935), <em>A Wreath for the Sea</em> (1943), <em>In the Rose of Time</em> (1956)––and adds to them two dozen later poems and a generous sampling from the wide range of his translations. Boylston Professor of Rhetoric at Harvard since 1965, Fitzgerald spends a part of each year with his family near Perugia, Italy, where he does most of his writing. He has received many honors in recent years, among them fellowship in the National Institute of Arts and Letters (1962) and the National Academy of Arts and Sciences (1963) and the first Bollingen Translation Award (1961) for his <em>Odyssey</em>.</p>

<p>Hailed by Robbe-Grillet as a new-wave novel twenty years ahead of its time, The Bark Tree (&ldquo;Le Chiendent&rdquo;), by the author of Zazie dans le Metro, first appeared in 1933. Queneau’s world, one of his characters explains, &ldquo;doesn’t have the meaning it attributes to itself.&rdquo; Instead, it threatens constantly to annul existence, isolating each event so that neither love nor suffering can be felt. Struggling with this Cartesian uncertainty, Pierre attempts to manipulate human destiny for his own amusement. Alternately, Etienne manages to go from silhouette to substance by acknowledging the absurd discontinuity of objects that make up the here and now. Around these two swarm a diverse group of characters, headed by a scheming old woman, who pursue and are affected by a nonexistent fortune. Their adventures, often indistinguishably shifting from reality to imagination, challenge with sympathy and intelligence the desperate, funny dilemma of being and humanity in a world of accident. Queneau, hovering somewhere between author and character, discovers his language as he creates it. Abrupt time shifts, puns, phonetic spelling, popular speech rhythms, deliberately incorrect grammar, all provide a guise of comic incongruity that engages the aimlessness of human experience with an almost mathematical complexity of design. The Bark Tree is truly one of the bench marks in the development and structure of modern fiction.</p>

<h2 id="slug-cawdor-and-medea">_slug: cawdor-and-medea</h2>

<p>Here for a new generation of readers and students are two major poetic works of Robinson Jeffers (1887-1962). The verse narrative <em>Cawdor</em>, set on the ruthless California coast which Jeffers knew so well, tells a simple tale: an aging widower, Cawdor, unwilling to relinquish his youth, knowingly marries a young girl who does not love him. She falls in love with his son, Hood, and the narrative unfolds in tragedy of immense proportions. <em>Medea</em> is a verse adaptation of Euripides’ drama and was created especially for the actress Judith Anderson. Their combined genius made the play one of the outstanding successes of the 1940’s. In <em>Medea</em>, Jeffers relentlessly drove toward what Ralph Waldo Emerson had called the proper tragic element-terror. <em>Cawdor</em> and <em>Medea</em> embody Jeffers’ most compelling themes and moods and convey his philosophy of “Inhumanism.”</p>

<p>William Carlos Williams was already developing and strengthening his American nativist position when Ezra Pound challenged him to close down his medical practice for a &ldquo;sabbatical&rdquo; in Europe. &ldquo;I think you are afraid to take it,&rdquo; Pound wrote, &ldquo;for fear of destroying some illusions which you think necessary to your illusions.&rdquo; Williams risked them and left for Paris. The itinerary of what Williams was to call his &ldquo;magnificent year&rdquo; forms the framework of <em>A Voyage to Pagany</em>. Its protagonist, young Dr. &ldquo;Dev&rdquo; Evans, from the &ldquo;New Jersey town of P. where he was born,&rdquo; is a tourist in Pagany––the name Williams chose for all Europe––glorying in its ancient monuments, its scientific, avant-garde and expatriate worlds, in its music and art and above all its people. Stimulated and bruised, he returns to America determined to discover what is genuinely poetic at home. The story is fictional but the character is the same Williams who went on to write <em>In the American Grain</em>, to celebrate in poetry and prose the American conscience and revitalize its tradition. In the Introduction, Harry Levin, the critic who has taken all literature since the Renaissance as his province, pinpoints <em>A Voyage to Pagany</em> in the development of Williams and in the mainstream of modem literature. He shows how Williams’s &ldquo;spontaneous energy made him an especially responsive witness to the American-European encounter.&rdquo;</p>

Reproduced in facsimile from Corso’s handwritten sheets, his marginal decorations, drawings and glyphs are included. The balance of the book is drawn from his shorter poems. Corso’s reputation as a leading poet and co-founder of the Beat movement is clearly upheld in these poems. His instinct for integrated lyrical statement, his special contribution to Beat poetry, is as strong as ever; his sense of humor and sexuality have not diminished. But he has added a wider-ranging moral urgency and a new depth of humane solicitude that hold even his strangest visions close to the heart of contemporary feeling.</p>

<h2 id="slug-the-air-conditioned-nightmare">_slug: the-air-conditioned-nightmare</h2>

<p>In 1939, after ten years as an expatriate, Henry Miller returned to the United States with a keen desire to see what his native land was really like––to get to the roots of the American nature and experience. He set out on a journey that was to last for three years, visiting many sections of the country and making friends of all descriptions. <em>The Air-Conditioned Nightmare</em> is the result of that odyssey. It is clear that Miller’s bad dream of the forties is still with us. He saw a nation of big business and little men, mass media at once soporific and violent, giant industries deadening workers and polluting the environment, of credit buying, cheap cars and gadgets ad infinitum, of misinformation and prejudice––a spiritual and aesthetic vacuum. One of his conclusions was that &ldquo;nowhere else in the world is the divorce between man and nature so complete.&rdquo; Yet Henry Miller falls in love with his automobile and weeps at the sight of the Grand Canyon. His stories and essays celebrate those rare individuals (famous and obscure) whose creative resilience and mere existence oppose the mechanization of minds and souls.</p>

<h2 id="slug-for-you">_slug: for-you</h2>

<p>This book collects five long poems that have previously appeared, with one exception, only in magazines and limited editions. One critic has called them &ldquo;virtually secret.&rdquo; Yet they are probably the heart of Carruth’s poetic achievement, both technically and thematically. Rising from the experience of emotional illness and the asylum, the poems move at intervals and over a period of nearly fifty years toward a sustained, workable view of humanity in crisis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have tried to create a person,&rdquo; Carruth writes, &ldquo;specifically a seeing, living, surmounting person. Modesty is important, and so are winter and the north. A man alone in the snow is still much in this world, including the social world, though his ’in-ness’ is naturally a form of rebellion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poems included are <em>The Asylum, Journey to a Known Place, North Winter, Contra Mortem</em> and <em>My Father’s Face</em>.</p>

<h2 id="slug-dragon-country">_slug: dragon-country</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Dragon country, the country of pain, is an uninhabitable country which is inhabited.&rdquo; So Tennessee Williams expressed the theme of &ldquo;endured but unendurable pain&rdquo; which runs through all of these eight plays. The most recent among them, <em>In the Bar of a Tokyo Hotel</em>, shows an artist, worn to a nervous ruin by a breakthrough in his painting technique, abandoned and destroyed by his witch of a wife. From earlier in the Sixties we have the two &ldquo;Slapstick Tragedies&rdquo;: _The Mutilated_––a once-beautiful woman whose breast has been removed is blackmailed by her &ldquo;friend&rdquo;––and <em>The</em> _Gnädiges Fräulein_––a &ldquo;celebrated soubrette&rdquo; is reduced to battling &ldquo;cocaloony birds&rdquo; for discarded fish on a Florida Key. <em>I Rise in Flame, Cried the Phoenix</em> is based on the death of D. H. Lawrence, while <em>I Can’t Imagine Tomorrow</em> is a paradigm of human inability to share or communicate. <em>Confessional</em> presents the &ldquo;regulars&rdquo; of a California beachfront bar: an aging beautician celebrating her brother’s &ldquo;death day,&rdquo; an alcoholic doctor who botches a difficult childbirth, and two men who give us new insight into the unique sadness of the &ldquo;gay&rdquo; world. The Frosted Glass Coffin reveals a group of elderly people in a retirement hotel, dying off one by one in the intense zinc-white light of Miami. Two women (with skin and weight problems) look for fun at a convention in <em>A Perfect Analysis Given by a Parrot</em>.</p>

<p>This selection from the Cantos was made by Ezra Pound himself in 1965. It is intended to indicate main elements in the long poem––his personal epic––with which he was engaged for more than fifty years. His choice includes, of course, a number of the Cantos most admired by critics and anthologists, such as Canto XIII (&ldquo;Kung [Confucius] walked by the dynastic temple…&rdquo;), Canto XLV (“With usura hath no man a house of good stone…”) and the passage from <em>The Pisan Cantos</em> (LXXXI) beginning “What thou lovest well remains / the rest is dross,” and so the book is an ideal introduction for newcomers to the great work. But it has, too, particular interest for the already initiated reader and the specialist, in its revelation, through Pound’s own selection of ’main elements,’ of the relative importance which he himself placed on various motifs as they figure in the architecture of the whole poem.</p>

<p>Here are the eleven remarkable stories of Tennessee Williams’s first volume of short fiction, originally published in 1948 and reissued as a paperbook in response to an increasingly insistent public demand. It was this book which established Williams as a short story writer of the same stature and interest he had shown as a dramatist. Each story has qualities that make it memorable. In “One Arm” we live through his last hours and memories with a ’rough trade&rdquo; ex-prizefighter who is awaiting execution for murder. &ldquo;The Field of Blue Children&rdquo; explores some of the strange ways of the human heart in love, &ldquo;Portrait of a Girl in Glass&rdquo; is a luminous and nostalgic recollection of characters who figure in &ldquo;The Glass Menagerie,&rdquo; while &ldquo;Desire and the Black Masseur&rdquo; is an excursion into the logic of the macabre. &ldquo;The Yellow Bird,&rdquo; well known through the author’s recorded reading of it, which tells of a minister’s daughter who found a particularly violent but satisfactory way of expiating a load of inherited puritan guilt, may well become part of American mythology.</p>

<p>Kenneth Rexroth’s translations of Chinese verse include &ldquo;poems of love, reverie and meditation in the midst of nature.&rdquo; As in his earlier <em>One Hundred Poems from the Chinese</em>, he adds even a few more &ldquo;for good measure and good luck.&rdquo; <em>Love and the Turning Year</em> includes a selection from the Yueh Fu––folk songs from the Six Dynasties Period (fourth-fifth centuries A.D.). Most of the songs are simple, erotic lyrics. Some are attributed to legendary courtesans, while others may have been sung at harvest festivals or marriage celebrations. In addition to the folk songs, Rexroth offers a wide sampling of Chinese verse: works by 60 different poets, from the third century to our own time. Rexroth always translated Chinese poetry––as he said––&rdquo;solely to please myself.&rdquo; And he created, with remarkable success, English versions which stand as poems in their own right.</p>

Probing even further than Snyder’s previous collection of poems, <em>The Back Country</em>, this new volume freshly explores &ldquo;the most archaic values on earth… the fertility of the soil, the magic of animals, the power-vision in solitude, the terrifying initiation and rebirth, the love and ecstasy of the dance, the common work of the tribe…”</p>

<h2 id="slug-the-collected-longer-poems">_slug: the-collected-longer-poems</h2>

<p>This is a companion volume to the <em>Collected Shorter Poems of Kenneth Rexroth</em> which was published in 1967. All of the long poems written over the past forty years are included: <em>The Homestead Called Damascus</em> (1920-25), <em>A Prolegomenon to a Theodicy</em> (1925-27), <em>The Phoenix and the Tortoise</em> (1940-44), <em>The Dragon and the Unicorn</em> (1944-50) and <em>The Heart’s Garden, The Garden’s Heart</em> (1967-68). As we read the long poems together and in sequence we can see that Rexroth is a philosophical poet of consequence who offers us a comprehensive system of values based on the realization of the ethical mysticism of universal responsibility. He is concerned, above all, with process: the movement from the Dual to the Other. &ldquo;I have tried,&rdquo; Rexroth writes,&rdquo; to embody in verse the belief that the only valid conservation of value lies in the assumption of unlimited liability, the supernatural identification of the self with the tragic unity of creative process. I hope I have made it clear that the self does not do this by an act of will, by sheer assertion. He who would save his life must lose it.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="slug-relearning-the-alphabet">_slug: relearning-the-alphabet</h2>

<p>Miss Levertov’s work has always been notable for its technical perfection––her unique control of verbal tone, line patterns and structure––but Relearning the Alphabet contains an impressive new dimension: an enlargement of scale, and an assurance, that have led her to poems of greater length and even deeper social commitment than she had attempted before. Many of her themes may still be personal––the loss of a friend’s child, a snail’s vision, a flea from a loving dog, her responses to nature––but more are now public: the Vietnam War, Biafra, ghetto riots, the battle of the Berkeley People’s Park in which she took part. Denise Levertov is a frequent speaker on college campuses, and has been actively involved in the Resistance movement. This experience of the counter culture is powerfully present in her new poems; it has made her an eloquent spokesman for the new American revolution.</p>

<h2 id="slug-paris-spleen">_slug: paris-spleen</h2>

<p>Baudelaire composed the series of prose poems known as <em>Paris Spleen</em> between 1855 and his death in 1867. He attached great importance to his work in this then unusual form, asking, &ldquo;Which one of us, in his moments of ambition, has not dreamed of the miracle of a poetic prose, musical, without rhythm and without rhyme, supple enough and rugged enough to adapt itself to the lyrical impulses of the soul, the undulations of reverie, the jibes of conscience?&rdquo; In his biography of Baudelaire, Lewis Piaget Shanks calls <em>Paris Spleen</em> &ldquo;the final expression of the poet’s vision of the world, of his melancholia, his idealism, his desperate desire to flee from the prison of his subjectivity, his furious longing to find some escape from the ugliness of modern life. They are the center of his work: absolutely devoid of pose, they explain all the rest of it.&rdquo; Where Baudelaire treated the same theme both in <em>Paris Spleen</em> and in <em>Flowers of Evil</em>, Enid Starkie finds the prose poems &ldquo;more mature in conception, containing more harmony in the contrast between the flesh and the spirit.&rdquo; Several of these &ldquo;corresponding&rdquo; poems are given in an appendix to this edition.</p>

<p>Dylan Thomas’s principal works for film and radio provide a rewarding experience for those readers who know him only through his poetry and stories. <em>The Doctor and the Devils</em> is the scenario for a feature-length film. This tale of murder is based on the famous case of the Scottish body-snatchers Burke and Hare, who thrilled newspaper readers in the mid-nineteenth century and whose crimes are still relished among homicide buffs today. Giving full rein to the macabre, Thomas created characters and an atmosphere worthy of his best short stories. There are also other Thomas scripts: his unfinished screen adaptation of Maurice O’Sullivan’s autobiographical memoir <em>Twenty Years A-Growing</em>, with a synopsis of Thomas’s probable approach to its completion; a short radio play produced by the BBC in 1946 and directly related to the later <em>Under Milk Wood</em>, with an essay in which Ralph Maud traces the textual relationship; and a group of captions in verse for photographs in the British magazine <em>Lilliput</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the vast majority of Italians and others to whom the name means anything, Matera is synonymous with abject poverty and backwardness. In fact, being the capital of its province, which occupies the lower and Eastern half of the region known today as La Basilicata, in the highlands inland between the Ionian Sea and the Adriatic, it is relatively affluent in a world where degradation is the rule. It has a railway terminal, all the functionary establishments of authority, more than a dozen churches, and a growing middle-class. In the outlying areas, in the castle villages perched on remote mountains, is poverty undisguised, unmitigated, and kept quiet. I came to this community quite by accident, penniless, and stayed to teach there for a year and a half. What I saw, what I learned, what I felt, my relations to others there and that of earth and air, fire and water, to them and to myself, should be implicit, if not explicit, in these poems.&rdquo; -Cid Corman</p>

<p>Gottfried Benn (1886-1957) occupies a position in modern German literature often compared to that of T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound in English. This volume presents a comprehensive anthology of the author’s finest work-poetry (with the German originals en face), short stories, a scene from one of his plays, essays and autobiographical writings, including a unique insight into the German intellectual metamorphosis before, under and after Hitler. And in a long introduction, the editor, E. B. Ashton, places Benn in the perspective of recent German history and gives an account of his life––a dramatic and moving story in its own right. By profession a physician, Benn was fascinated by the philosophical aspects of many branches of science, and over the years he wrote a number of extraordinary essays in which the poet’s intuitive vision was accorded the utmost imaginative freedom. These &ldquo;primal visions&rdquo; of the 1920s anticipated in certain ways the positions of such writers today as Beckett and Genet, the French &ldquo;antinovelists&rdquo; and the American &ldquo;Beats.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="slug-the-growth-of-milkwood">_slug: the-growth-of-milkwood</h2>

<p><em>Under Milk Wood</em> was originally conceived by Dylan Thomas a a radio work––&rdquo;A Play for Voices&rdquo;––and was first broadcast on the B.B.C. Third Programme in January 1954, two months after his death. But during the three or four years that he was working on it, he made various revisions for solo performances and stage readings of the incomplete script. As a result, there are no less than eleven versions in which the text differs in greater or lesser degree. But none of them can rank as the definitive text of this world-famous work, which has been translated into well over a dozen languages, including Serbo-Croat, Japanese and even Welsh. Douglas Cleverdon was associated with <em>Under Milk Wood</em> from its beginnings, first produced it for radio, subsequently co-directed the stage production at the Edinburgh Festival and in the West End, and finally directed it on Broadway. Better than any other living man, he is qualified both to analyze the textual variations and to trace the complicated––and occasionally hilarious––development of the script. The first part of the volume describes the outstanding achievements of Dylan Thomas in radio, as actor, poetry-reader and writer; and recounts the history of <em>Under Milk Wood</em> after an amateur dramatic performance in Laugharne in 1939, through the tribulations of his last years, when debts and drinking and recital tours inhibited him from concentration on his writing, to the publication of the 1958 Acting Edition. The second part contains an analysis of all the textual variants in the eleven versions (which comprise published texts, duplicated typescripts for performances, and recordings). The analysis includes punctuation and the line indentations that affect the tempo and the rhythm of dramatic production. It is hoped that the meticulous attention to detail is justified by the interest shown throughout the world in the writings of Dylan Thomas.</p>

<h2 id="slug-guignols-band">_slug: guignols-band</h2>

<p>In <em>Guignol’s Band</em>, first published in France in 1943, Céline explores the horror of a disordered world. The hero, the semi-autobiographical Ferdinand, moves through the nightmare of London’s underworld during the years of World War I. In this distressing setting, he meets pimps and prostitutes, pawnbrokers and magicians, policemen and arsonists. He sees social and physiological decomposition as these processes unfold along parallel lines of development. The illusions of existence are nakedly exposed. The narrative erupts in Céline’s characteristic elliptical style. His splintered sentences and scatology reflect his fury at the fragmentation of experience and at his own impotence in the face of it. Out of his rage, he forces the meaninglessness back on itself, and the exuberance of his struggle triumphs in the comic exaggeration of satire. Ultimately, his subject is not death but life, and he responds to it by a strengthened commitment to the sensual and concrete.

<h2 id="slug-sleepers-awake">_slug: sleepers-awake</h2>

<p><em>Sleepers Awake</em>, first published in 1946, is one of Kenneth Patchen’s major prose books. A work of extraordinary imaginative invention, it might be described as &ldquo;novelistic fantasy&rdquo;––a pioneering new direction in fiction which created its own protean form as it was written. Patchen mingled narrative with dream visions, surrealism with satire, poetry with statements of principle, and explored the then almost uncharted territory of visual word structures twenty years before &ldquo;Concrete Poetry&rdquo; became a popular international movement. <em>Sleepers Awake</em> is a rallying cry to young and old, as Patchen advances his long struggle against inhumanity, oppression, war and hypocrisy. Now brutal, now lyrical, he gives us life and the world as we must take them if they are to have full meaning, the horror and the beauty, the joy and the suffering together.</p>

<p>The study of Chinese culture was a dominant concern in Ezra Pound’s life and work. His great Canto XIII is about Kung (Confucius), Cantos LII-LXI deal with Chinese history, and in the later Cantos key motifs are often given in Chinese quotations with the characters set into the English text. His introduction to Oriental literature was chiefly through Ernest Fenollosa whose translations and notes were given him by the scholars widow in London about 1913. From these notebooks came, in time, the superb poems entitled <em>Cathay</em> and Pound’s edition of Fenollosa’s <em>Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry</em>. But it was Confucius’ ethical and political teachings––that most influenced Pound. And now, for the first time, his versions, with commentary, of three basic texts that he translated have been assembled in one volume: <em>The Great Digest</em> (Ta Hsio), first published in 1928; <em>The Unwobbling Pivot</em> (Chung Yung), 1947; and <em>The Analects</em> (Lun-yü), 1950. For the first two, the Chinese characters from the ancient &ldquo;Stone Classics” are printed en face in our edition, with a note by Achilles Fang. Pound never wanted to be a literal translator. What he could do, as no other could, is to identify the essence, pick out &ldquo;what matters now,&rdquo; and phrase it so pungently, so beautifully, that it will stick in the head and start new thinking.</p>

<p>Guillevic is one of the most highly regarded among living French poets but, although he gave readings in New York and Montreal in 1968, he is still too little known on this side of the Atlantic. Now this bilingual collection of his work, chosen from six of his books published between 1942 and 1966, and translated by the poet Denise Levertov, should bring him the wider audience his work deserves. Guillevic was born in Carnac in 1907 of peasant stock. He sees the profoundly austere Breton landscapes (and all else in life) not as incidental backgrounds, but as elemental, living presences. His poems embody his indignation at the use and misuse of some human beings by others—as well as his cold and clear understanding of historical process. Like William Carlos Williams, he has a sharp eye, and as Miss Levertov points out in her introduction, “… the simplicity of diction, the plain and hard meaning of things without descriptive qualification, reverberates, in the highly charged condensation of Guillevic’s poems, with the ambiguity, the unfathomable mystery of natural objects.” In translating these poems, Denise Levertov has drawn upon the affinity that exists between her own style and Guillevic’s. She has attained comparable effects of concision and clarity and has reproduced with great subtlety the characteristic rhythm and cadence patterns of the French originals.</p>

<p>From the appearance in 1936 of Kenneth Patchen’s first book, the voice of this great poet has been protesting war and social injustice, satirizing the demeaning and barbarous inanities of our culture––entrancing us with an inexhaustible flow of humor and fantasy. With directness and simplicity, he has restored the exultation of romantic love to its ancient bardic place beside an awareness of God’s living presence among all men. Kenneth Patchen assembled this collection in his fifty-fourth year. Since space was the only restricting factor in his choice, readers are given a direct and first-time insight into the poet’s own estimate of his concern. Additionally, the texts of many long-unavailable poems are provided.</p>

<p>This collection, first published by New Directions in 1939, contains a number of Henry Miller’s most important shorter prose writings. They are taken from the Paris books <em>Black Spring</em> (1936) and <em>Max and the White Phagocytes</em> (1938) and were, for the most part, written at about the same time as _Tropic of Capricorn_––the period of Miller’s and Durrell’s life in the famous Villa Seurat in Paris. As is usual with Miller, these pieces cannot be tagged with the label of any given literary category. The unforgettable portrait of Max, the Paris drifter, and the probably-autobiographical Tailor Shop, are basically short stories, but even here the irrepressible vitality of Miller’s personality keeps breaking into the narrative. And in the critical and philosophical essays, the prose poems and surrealist fantasies, the travel sketches and scenarios, Miller’s passion for fiction, for telling the endless story of his extraordinary life, cannot be held down. Life, as no other modern author has lived it or can write it, bursts from these pages––the life of the mind and the body; of people, places and things; of ideas and the imagination.</p>

<h2 id="slug-the-geography-of-lograire">_slug: the-geography-of-lograire</h2>

<p>Thomas Merton’s final testament as a poet is his most ambitious long work and a remarkable poetic achievement. It was completed in the summer of 1968, a few months before he set out from Our Lady of Gethsemani monastery in Kentucky on the Asian journey from which he did not return. The text is as he left it. It lacks that final editing that he would have done in proof, but it is substantially a completed, self-contained work. Lograire, as with William Carlos Williams’s Paterson, is first of all a country of the imagination, but it is also a person––Merton himself––for its &ldquo;geography&rdquo; is the map, the inner choreography, of his mind. The charting in the poem is his search for self-location: where, and even how, does a man find himself in the geography of all men? Sections of personal experience are set against passages re-imagined from anthropological and historical texts, material that Merton chose for its character of myth to illustrate the general experience of mankind. The myths of Lograire form a mosaic of African legends, Mixtecart motifs and Mayan religious customs, the pantheism of the fanatical Ranters in 17th-century England, the records of an early arctic expedition and of Ibn Battuta, the 14th-century Arab traveler, the Cargo Cults of Melanesia and the Ghost Dances of the American Indians. &ldquo;A poet,&rdquo; Merton wrote in his prefatory note to Lograire, &ldquo;spends his life attempting to build or to dream the world in which he lives. But more than that he realizes that this world is at once his and everybody’s. It grows out of a common participation which is nevertheless recorded in authentically personal images. I have without scruple mixed what is my own experience with what is almost everybody else’s.&rdquo; Many modern poets have used history and myth in their work; what sets <em>The Geography of Lograire</em> apart is the invention of Merton’s method––his process for elevating fact to the level of myth. It is a complex technique of fractured syntax, multiple meanings; the distortion of dream, irony and parody.</p>

<p>One of the great fiction writers of Japan, Ihara Saikaku (1623-93) wrote of the lowest class in the Tokugawa world––the townsmen who were rising in wealth and power but not in official status. The title story in this collection of 12 works, told by an aging beauty whose highly erotic nature is her constant undoing, ranges over all of 17th-century Japanese life. The narrator is successively wife, court lady, courtesan, priest’s concubine, mistress of a feudal lord and streetwalker. Ivan Morris, chairman of the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures of Columbia University has done a brilliant translation, an introduction, extensive notes, bibliography and two essays on social customs of the period.

<p>Both Pound and Williams have shown how a good poet can revitalize prose style. <em>Earth House Hold</em> (a play on the root meanings of &ldquo;ecology&rdquo;) drawn from Gary Snyder’s essays and journals, may prove a landmark for the new generation. “As a poet,&rdquo; Snyder tells us, &ldquo;I hold the most archaic values on earth. They go back to the late Paleolithic; the fertility of the soil, the magic of animals, the power-vision in solitude, the terrifying initiation and rebirth; the love and Ecstasy of the dance, the common work of the tribe.&rdquo; He develops, as replacement for shattered social structures, a concept of tribal tradition which could lead to &ldquo;growth and enlightenment in self-disciplined freedom. Whatever is or ever was in any other culture can be reconstructed from the unconscious through meditation &hellip; the coming revolution will close the circle––and link us in many ways with the most creative aspects of our archaic past.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The Secret Meaning of Things</em> is Lawrence Ferlinghetti’s fourth book of poems, and it has all the elements of his earlier poetry: lyrical intensity, wit, social concern, satirical bite, and above all a classical claritas. But it goes much further: there is a deepening of vision and a darker understanding of &ldquo;our clay condition.&rdquo; The six long poems in <em>The Secret Meaning of Things</em> show a progressive continuity and clarity of perception that apprehends both the hard reality and luminous irreality in everyday phenomena. In &ldquo;Assassination Raga&rdquo;––on the death of Robert Kennedy––the glass through which the poet sees darkly is the television screen; the poem was first read on the night of RFK’s funeral at a mass memorial in San Francisco. &ldquo;Bickford’s Buddha&rdquo; is a meditation on &ldquo;Observation Fever&rdquo; in Harvard Square, while &ldquo;All Too Clearly&rdquo; finds a &ldquo;touch of old surrealism/at a stoplight in La Jolla.&rdquo; &ldquo;Through the Looking Glass&rdquo; begins with an actual flight aboard a commercial airliner and moves through a psychedelic vision to a final flash of the Dance of Shiva, which in turn opens out into the worldview of &ldquo;After the Cries of Birds.&rdquo; &ldquo;Moscow in the Wilderness, Segovia in the Snow&rdquo; comes out of Ferlinghetti’s travels to Moscow and across the steppes in the winter of 1967.</p>

<p>In 1958, when Henry Miller was elected to membership in the American Institute of Arts and Letters, the citation described him as: &ldquo;The veteran author of many books whose originality and richness of technique are matched by the variety and daring of his subject matter. His boldness of approach and intense curiosity concerning man and nature are unequalled in the prose literature of our times.&rdquo; It is most fitting that this anthology of &ldquo;the best&rdquo; of Henry Miller should have been assembled by one of the first among Miller’s contemporaries to recognize his genius, the eminent British writer Lawrence Durrell. Drawing material from a dozen different books Durrell has traced the main line and principal themes of the &ldquo;single, endless autobiography&rdquo; which is Henry Miller’s life work. &ldquo;I suspect,&rdquo; writes Durrell in his Introduction, &ldquo;that Miller’s final place will be among those towering anomalies of authorship like Whitman or Blake who have left us, not simply works of art, but a corpus of ideas which motivate and influence a whole cultural pattern.&rdquo; Earlier, H. L. Mencken had said, &ldquo;his is one of the most beautiful prose styles today,&rdquo; and the late Sir Herbert Read had written that &ldquo;what makes Miller distinctive among modern writers is his ability to combine, without confusion, the aesthetic and prophetic functions.&rdquo; Included are stories, &ldquo;portraits&rdquo; of persons and places, philosophical essays, and aphorisms. For each selection Miller himself prepared a brief commentary which fits the piece into its place in his life story. This framework is supplemented by a chronology from Miller’s birth in 1891 up to the spring of 1959, a bibliography, and, as an appendix, an open letter to the Supreme Court of Norway written in protest of the ban on Sexus, a part of which appears in this volume.</p>

<p><em>The Build-up</em>, Volume 3 of the <em>Stecher Trilogy</em>, picks up the thread of <em>White Mule</em> and <em>In the Money</em>. Although all of the novels deal with the triumphant rise of an immigrant family in the early 1900s, <em>the Build-up</em> is more concerned with the overwhelming drive and ambition of Joe Stecher’s wife, Gurlie. After years of hard work, careful planning (and his wife’s badgering) Joe’s printing business is providing his family with a comfortable income. As soon as her financial goal is realized, Gurlie focuses her attention on another area. Her phenomenal energy is soon earning her all unassailable position as a social leader in a small New Jersey suburb. Her achievement is not without its heartache, however. This story is told with all the gentle humor and exacting detail that mark Williams’s prose works.</p>

<h2 id="slug-once-again">_slug: once-again</h2>

<p>This collection presents one of the most interesting and lively developments on the international poetry scene in recent years. Concrete Poetry has been growing in many countries, from Brazil to Japan, and especially in England and Europe. Its ancestry goes back to pre-historic picture writing and the anagrams of early Christian monks; it has affinities with the oriental ideogram, and, in our century, with Apollinaire’s Calligrammes, the work of Klee and Schwitters, and the experiments in &ldquo;visual form&rdquo; of Cummings, Dylan Thomas, and the Dadaists and Surrealists. A number of American poets have now begun to do Concrete Poetry, there have been special numbers of <em>Chicago Review</em> and <em>The Beloit Poetry Journal</em> devoted to it, and The Something Else Press of New York published last year an anthology edited by Emmett Williams. <em>Once Again</em> is not so much an anthology, though it includes the work of 54 poets from 10 countries, as a group presentation, designed to be read as a consecutive &ldquo;visual happening.&rdquo; It has been assembled by Jean-François Bory, an editor of the Paris magazine <em>Approches</em> and the author of <em>Plein Signe</em>, <em>Height Texts + 1</em> and other &ldquo;Concrete&rdquo; books. Bory has provided an introduction which traces the history 0f the movement and analyzes its aesthetic. He also comments on individual poems. The American poets in <em>Once Again</em> are: Alain Arias-Misson, Jeff Berner, Wally Depew, Carl Fernbach-Flarsheim, Ken Friedman, Ronald Johnson, Alison Knowles, Richard Kostelanetz, D. A. Levy, Lilian Lijn, Cyril Miles, Norman Ogue Mustil, Ad Reinhardt, Aram Saroyan, Mary Ellen Solt, Jonathan Williams.</p>

<h2 id="slug-the-setting-sun">_slug: the-setting-sun</h2>

<p>This powerful novel of a nation in social and moral crisis was first published by New Directions in 1956. Set in the early postwar years, it probes the destructive effects of war and the transition from a feudal Japan to an industrial society. Ozamu Dazai died, a suicide, in 1948. But the influence of his book has made &ldquo;people of the setting sun&rdquo; a permanent part of the Japanese language, and his heroine, Kazuko, a young aristocrat who deliberately abandons her class, a symbol of the anomie which pervades so much of the modern world.</p>

<p>Thomas Merton, who died in Bangkok, Thailand, in 1968, was internationally recognized as having one of those rare Western minds which was entirely at home in Asian experience. In this collection of essays he wrote about complex Asian concepts with a Western directness. One reason for this skill is that he had not only studied Buddhism from the outside, but had grasped it by empathy and living participation from within––while remaining a priest and Trappist monk. Like his friend, the late D. T. Suzuki, Merton believed that there must be a little of Zen in all authentic creative and spiritual experience. The Study of Zen, then, is not a study of doctrine, still less a polemic about ultimate religious principles. It is simply an attempt to reach the ground of pure, direct experience which underlies all creative thought and activity. Father Merton’s essays approach this experience through Japanese art and philosophy (Kitaro Nishida), through the Zen of Suzuki, and through the Classic Zen Masters themselves. The dialogue between Merton and Suzuki (&ldquo;Wisdom in Emptiness&rdquo;) explores the many congruencies of Christian mysticism and Zen.</p>

<p>Rimbaud––a mythic name––his life as extraordinary as his work was influential in redirecting the course, first of French, and then of world poetry. He is, indeed, the very symbol of what we now call &ldquo;modern&rdquo; literature; nearly a hundred years before the arrival of the &ldquo;mind-expanding&rdquo; drugs, Rimbaud understood that the borders of the writer’s consciousness must be extended and made the deliberate attempt to use hallucination as a creative method. Dr. Starkie devoted many years of research to Rimbaud, revising her biography three times as new manuscript material and information about him came to light.</p>

<p>In England and America Dylan Thomas made his art and personality widely known through public readings, radio broadcasts and recordings. Many of the 25 short stories, autobiographical sketches and essays in <em>Quite Early One Morning</em>, a volume planned by Thomas shortly before his death, were read by him on such occasions. They are alive with his verbal magic, his intense perception of life, his gargantuan humor and with the very ring of his voice. Included in this collection of prose pieces are such favorites as the hilarious &ldquo;A Visit to America,&rdquo; the account of a small boy’s marvelous day’s outing––&rdquo;A Story,&rdquo; and the memorable &ldquo;A Child’s Christmas in Wales&rdquo; which has been called ’the twentieth century Christmas Carol.’ Other pieces show Thomas’s power as a sensitive critic of poetry and as an exponent of his own intent as a poet.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Young Dog&rdquo; of the title is of course Thomas himself, and this volume of autobiographical stories by the great modern poet, who died at 39 while on his third lecture tour in the United States, shows his waggish humor at its best, his exuberance and verbal magic in spectacular display. It also shows him a spinner of tales and a creator of memorable characters. There is the grandfather who marches off in his best clothes to be buried in the next town, the sardonic &ldquo;senior reporter&rdquo; on a provincial newspaper, servant girls who know how to deal triumphantly with a fast-talking dandy, a twenty-year-old farmer preaching wildly to boys in a deserted barn, a group of respectable worthies who play at literature behind closed blinds, and always the observant and unfazed young Thomas. Few writers have evoked as successfully the mysteries and adventures of boyhood, of young love with its shattered dreams, or of death haunting two lads at play: none has done it in as fresh and telling phrases, with an elation as natural and contagious.</p>

<p>As a rule, a good novel does not always make a good play––especially a novel as unconventional as this one by Dylan Thomas. But Andrew Sinclair’s brilliant adaptation of <em>Adventures in the Skin Trade</em> is the exception. This is the story of young Samuel Bennet––a not entirely innocent provincial––who leaves his Welsh home to let adventure find him in London. Sam is soon deeply involved––all the while with his finger stuck fast in an ale bottle––with a fantastic assortment of odd characters whom only Dylan Thomas could have conceived. What <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em> said about <em>Adventures in the Skin Trade</em> as a novel still applies to the play: &ldquo;There is no doubt of Thomas’s genius as a comic writer &hellip; there are memorable images and phrases on every page.&rdquo; One reason is Andrew Sinclair’s exceptionally skillful adaptation.</p>

<p>The lead piece in the ND Annual is an important essay by Thomas Merton, &ldquo;Symbolism: Communication or Communion,&rdquo; which goes to the core of a crucial issue: the function, and malfunction, of language, of writing as it should affect and direct our actions&ndash;individual, social, international&ndash;in the world today.</p>

<p>In &ldquo;Some Notes on Organic Form,&rdquo; Denise Levertov examines the poetics which underlie the most vital new direction in American poetry of the past decade, the movement toward &ldquo;open&rdquo; forms inspired by the theories of Charles Olson and the practice of William Carlos Williams. She shows how this kind of poetry is conceived and structured, how its form is the revelation of its content.</p>

<p>From England comes a long excerpt from Alan Burns’ <em>Europe after the Rain</em>, a powerful work which extends the range of Surrealist fiction. And from Scotland, the complete text of Ian Hamilton Finlay’s early book of poems, <em>The Dancers Inherit the Party</em>, never before published in this country.

<h2 id="slug-bending-the-bow">_slug: bending-the-bow</h2>

<p>In <em>Bending the Bow</em>, which presents his work in poetry since <em>Roots and Branches</em>, Robert Duncan is writing on a scale which places him among the poets, after Walt Whitman, bold enough to attempt the personal epic, the large-canvas rendering of man’s spirit in history as one man sees it, feels it, lives it, and makes it his own. In &ldquo;Structures of Rime,&rdquo; the open series begun in <em>The Opening of the Field</em> and continued in this volume, Duncan works with ideas, forces, and persons created in language itself––the life and identity of the poet in the poem. With the first thirty poems of &ldquo;Passages,&rdquo; which form the structural base in <em>Bending the Bow</em>, he has begun a second open series––a multiphasic projection of movements in a field, an imagined universe of the poem that moves out to include all the terms of experience as meaning. Here Duncan draws upon and in turn contributes to a mode in American poetry where Pound’s <em>Cantos</em>, Williams’s <em>Paterson</em>, Zukofsky’s “<em>A</em>,” and Olson’s <em>Maximus Poems</em> have led the way. The chronological composition of <em>Bending the Bow</em> emphasizes Duncan’s belief that the significance of form is that of an event in process. Thus, the poems of the two open series belong ultimately to the configuration of a life in poetry in which there are forms moving within and interpenetrating forms. Versions of Verlaine’s <em>Saint Graal</em> and <em>Parsifal</em> and a translation of Gérard de Nerval’s <em>Les Chimères</em> enter the picture; narrative bridges for the play <em>Adam’s Way</em> have their place in the process; and three major individual poems––&rdquo;My Mother Would Be a Falconress,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Shrine to Ameinias,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Epilogos&rdquo;––among others make for an interplay of frames of reference and meaning in which even such resounding blasts of outrage at the War in Vietnam as &ldquo;Up Rising&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Soldiers&rdquo; are not for the poet things in themselves but happenings in a poetry that involve all other parts of his experience.</p>

<h2 id="slug-guide-to-kulchur">_slug: guide-to-kulchur</h2>

<p><em>The Guide to Kulchur</em>, first published in 1938, is one of Ezra Pound’s most stimulating books. As might be expected, this is no ordinary Baedeker of the arts, no conventional tour of familiar landmarks and highspots, but an iconoclastic revision of the cultural (in the broadest sense) curriculum. In a sequence of short, pungent chapters, Pound covers the whole territory of &ldquo;kulchur&rdquo;––from the Chinese philosophers to modern poetry, from music to economics––as he discovered it for himself in a lifetime of reading, looking, and listening. &ldquo;This book,&rdquo; he says in his foreword, &ldquo;is not written for the over-fed. It is written for men who have not been able to afford a university education or for young men, whether or not threatened with universities, who want to know more at the age of fifty than I know today, and whom I might conceivably aid to that object.&rdquo; Here we have Pound the teacher, and he is a good one; whatever he touches comes alive for the student. Long-accepted wrong judgments are rudely exposed. Neglected writers are given their due. Essences are defined and separated from what is superficial. The reader is challenged to explore new areas, reinterpret history, and radically rethink the bases of his own tastes.</p>

<p>This is the record of one of the most interesting personal relationships of modern literature. Between 1913, when Yeats first called Joyce’s work to Pound’s attention, and 1920 there was a steady flow of letters, in which we see Pound finding publishers for Joyce, collecting money for him, defending him against censorship, even sending spare clothes. More than sixty letters from Pound to Joyce have survived, while those from Joyce to Pound will be found in the Viking Press Joyce correspondence volumes. Perhaps the most remarkable letters are those in which Pound gives his spontaneous reactions as the scripts of <em>Dubliners</em>, <em>Portrait of the Artist</em>, <em>Exiles</em> and <em>Ulysses</em> first reached him. We can then trace how these judgments were refined and amplified in the series of pieces that Pound wrote on Joyce for various magazines, the earliest sustained criticism of his work. And finally there are the later insights of the Rome broadcast of 1941 and the references to Joyce in <em>The Pisan Cantos</em>. Pound/Joyce has been edited, with an introduction, extensive running commentary, notes, and a wealth of related material from many sources, by Forrest Read, who is Professor of English at the University of North Carolina.</p>

<p>One of Henry Miller’s most luminous statements of his personal philosophy of life, <em>Stand Still Like the Hummingbird</em>, provides a symbolic title for this collection of stories and essays. Many of them have appeared only in foreign magazines while others were printed in small limited editions which have gone out of print. Miller’s genius for comedy is at its best in &ldquo;Money and How It Gets That Way&rdquo;––a tongue-in-cheek parody of &ldquo;economics&rdquo; provoked by a postcard from Ezra Pound which asked if he had &ldquo;ever thought about money.&rdquo; His deep concern for the role of the artist in society appears in &ldquo;An Open Letter to All and Sundry,&rdquo; and in &ldquo;The Angel Is My Watermark&rdquo; he writes of his own passionate love affair with painting. &ldquo;The Immorality of Morality&rdquo; is an eloquent discussion of censorship. Some of the stories, such as &ldquo;First Love,&rdquo; are autobiographical, and there are portraits of friends, such as &ldquo;Patchen: Man of Anger and Light,&rdquo; and essays on such other writers as Walt Whitman, Thoreau, Sherwood Anderson and lonesco. Taken together, these highly readable pieces reflect the incredible vitality and variety of interests of the writer who extended the frontiers of modern literature with <em>Tropic of Cancer</em> and other great books.</p>

<p>First published by New Directions in 1940, <em>In the Money</em> is a sequel to <em>White Mule</em>, and the second volume in Dr. Williams’s “Stecher Trilogy,&rdquo; but it also stands alone as a novel complete in itself. <em>White Mule</em> is a study of childhood––of the baby Flossie Stecher and her sister Lottie, and their parents, Joe and Gurlie Stecher, of German and Norwegian origin, living in New York before the first World War. <em>In the Money</em> is Joe Stecher’s success story––the tale of his fight against graft and injustice to found his own business and get “into the money.&rdquo; Joe is by nature quiet and reserved. But his wife Gurlie is full of ambition and drives him on toward the things she wants––position and a home of her own. It is a simple story, yet a meaningful one––a typical American situation. As a novelist, one of Dr. Williams’s strengths is his striking use of detail, an “objectivism,&rdquo; related to the style of his poetry; which achieves great, even symbolic force in its enlargement of the minutiae of American life and character.</p>

<p>Raja Rao’s <em>Kanthapura</em> is one of the finest novels to come out of mid-twentieth century India. It is the story of how Gandhi’s struggle for independence from the British came to a typical village, Kanthapura, in South India. Young Moorthy, back from the city with &ldquo;new ideas,&rdquo; cuts across the ancient barriers of caste to unite the villagers in non-violent action––which is met with violence by landlords and police. The dramatic tale unfolds in a poetic, almost mythical style which conveys as never before the rich textures of Indian rural life. The narrator is an old woman, imbued with the legendary history of the region, who knows the past of all the characters and comments on their actions with sharp-eyed wisdom. Her narrative, and the way she tells it, evokes the spirit of India’s traditional folk-epics. This edition includes extensive notes on Indian myths, religion, social customs, and the Independence movement (given at the end of the book) which fill out the background for the American reader’s more complete understanding and enjoyment.</p>

<p>Federico García Lorca’s position as one of the few geniuses of the modern theatre was firmly established in the English-speaking world with his <em>Three Tragedies</em>. Here, with an introduction by the dramatist’s brother, Francisco García Lorca, are five of his “comedies,” in the authorized translations, extensively revised to reflect recent Lorca scholarship and to convey the sparkle, freshness, and magic of the original Spanish.</p>

<p><em>The Shoemaker’s Prodigious Wife</em> tells of a young beauty married to an old man, a theme that often concerned Lorca. The resolution for the earnest shoemaker, who leaves home and comes back disguised as a puppeteer, is lighthearted, but there is underlying pathos.</p>

<p><em>The Love of Don Perlimplin</em> is again about a girl who weds someone much older, this time a bookish, 18th-century gentleman, who seeks an original but sardonic way out of the situation.</p>

<p>According to Lorca himself, “<em>Doña Rosita</em> is the outer gentleness and inner scorching of a girl in Granada who, little by little, turns into that grotesque and moving thing — an old maid in Spain.”</p>

<p>The two other comedies, published here in book form in English for the first time, are <em>The Billy-Club</em> _Puppets _— a guignol-type farce with delicate wit; and <em>The Butterfly’s Evil Spell</em>, an &ldquo;insect comedy&rdquo; about a beetle-poet who aspires to be a butterfly.</p>

<p><em>The Beetle Leg</em>, John Hawkes’s second full-length novel, was first published by New Directions in 1951.

As a ’surrealist Western&rdquo; (<em>Newsweek</em>), and a violent and poetic portrayal of &ldquo;a landscape of sexual apathy&rdquo; (Albert J. Guerard), <em>The Beetle Leg</em> is a rich flight into the special vein of comedy that Hawkes had begun to exploit a decade before the popular acceptance of &ldquo;black humor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the great figures who pioneered the modern movement in world literature, none showed himself more versatile than France’s Jean Cocteau. Poet, novelist, critic, artist, actor, film-maker, Cocteau was also one of the greatest dramatists Europe has produced, with over a dozen plays which are frequently revived, not only in France, but in translation in many other countries. For this collection, fine translations of four full-length plays, one short play, and the “Speaker’s Text&rdquo; for the Cocteau-Stravinsky opera <em>Oedipus Rex</em> have been selected. The longer plays (<em>The Infernal Machine</em>, <em>Orpheus</em>, Bacchus, <em>Knights of the Round Table</em>) are re-creations of classic myth and legend—poetic and highly original interpretations of certain timeless themes which have inspired great drama through the ages. <em>The Eiffel Tower Wedding Party</em> is, by contrast, merely a &ldquo;curtain-raiser,&rdquo; but remarkable as un jeu d’esprit, revealing the wit and psychological penetration for which Cocteau is famous.</p>

The first section, <em>Pictures from Brueghel</em>, contains previously uncollected short poems, while the second and third parts are the complete texts of <em>The Desert Music</em> (1954) and <em>Journey to Love</em> (1955), originally published by Random House. In these books, Dr. Williams perfected his &ldquo;variable foot&rdquo; metric and achieved full mastery of the &ldquo;American idiom&rdquo; which was his lifelong first concern. Among the poems of this period is the long &ldquo;Asphodel, That Greeny Flower&rdquo; which W. H. Auden has called &ldquo;one of the most beautiful love poems in the language.&rdquo; <em>Pictures from Brueghel</em> was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry only two months after William Carlos Williams’ death on March 4, 1963.</p>

<h2 id="slug-hard-candy">_slug: hard-candy</h2>

<p><em>Hard Candy</em> contains Tennessee Williams’s short stories written after the publication of his first collection of short fiction, <em>One Arm</em>, and before the stories appearing in <em>The Knightly Quest</em>. These volumes have established him as an original, compelling, and honest master of the short story. The stories in <em>Hard Candy</em> display Mr. Williams’s mastery of several very different styles. &ldquo;Three Players of a Summer Game,&rdquo; for instance, is as powerful and moving a study of the disintegration of an individual as <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em>. The delicate and luminous nostalgia of &ldquo;The Resemblance Between a Violin Case and a Coffin&rdquo; will remind readers of <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>. Other stories, like &ldquo;Two on a Party,&rdquo; are more colloquial and brittle; and one––&rdquo;The Coming of Something to the Widow Holly&rdquo;––is an excursion into ironical fantasy. Yet each of the stories demonstrates, in its different way, the characteristic blend of psychological penetration with compassion and understanding that has marked Tennessee Williams’s successes in the theater.</p>

<h2 id="slug-selected-writings1">_slug: selected-writings1</h2>

<p>This is the first presentation in depth of the work of one of the most influential writers of modern France, Jules Supervielle (1884-1960). Up to now, only an occasional selection has appeared in an anthology, and he is still little known to American readers. Yet Supervielle is one of the unique creators of our time. His fables have the clear-eyed, slightly wry vision of the intelligent child. His poems have a Iucidity of language that throws new light on each word, each thought. In his novel <em>The Man Who Stole Children</em>, complete in this volume, he uses the fantastic premise that a child uncared for by its parents may simply be picked up off the street and adopted, to illuminate man’s problems of human behavior and emotion. Supervielle in his poetry and prose, as in his personal influence on other writers, is quiet, unassuming, matter-of-fact. There is a quietness, too, almost an impersonality about his approach to life and the events of every day. His poems are statements and almost never is there the fireworks of imagery or startling figure of speech that one associates with some twentieth-century schools of writing. Throughout his work may be felt the vast spaces of Uruguay, where he was born, and of the sea, a pervading symbol. This edition contains eight of his stories. translated by Enid McLeod, more than forty of his poems with French text en face translated by James Kirkup, Denise Levertov, and Kenneth Rexroth, and the complete novel, <em>Le Voleur d’enfants</em>, translated by Alan Pryce-Jones.</p>

<p>When this book was first published (as <em>Summer Knowledge</em>) in 1959, Delmore Schwartz was still riding a crest, the golden boy of the literary scene––a position he had commanded ever since the appearance of his first collection of stories and poems in 1938. <em>Summer Knowledge</em> won for him both the prestigious Bollingen Prize in Poetry and the Poetry Society of America’s Shelley Memorial Award. Ironically, indeed tragically, the praise and prizes Schwartz’s poems received did not forestall his decline, and this, his poetic testament, proved to be a final one as well. Overcome by mental illness, alienated from his friends and supporters, he disappeared from the literary scene, in the end to die in 1966 in an obscure Broadway hotel. The tragedy of his life pales before the triumph of his art and craft. <em>Selected Poems</em> clearly places him among the foremost poets of his generation.</p>

<h2 id="slug-white-mule">_slug: white-mule</h2>

<p>Williams was foremost a poet, but the novels are of great interest. They are important books in their own right, because they present with a poet’s insight, and in a prose style of striking originality, aspects of American life which few other writers have approached. <em>White Mule</em> and its sequels, <em>In the Money</em> and <em>The Build-Up</em>, form a trilogy, the saga of the Stecher family, but each volume is a complete novel by itself. Joe Stecher and Gurlie, his wife, are a young couple of European origin settled in New York at the turn of the century and working to make a place for themselves in the new world. <em>White Mule</em> is the story of Joe’s inner struggle between love of fine craftsmanship (he is a printer by trade) and Gurlie’s ambition to get ahead, to have him get &ldquo;in the money.&rdquo; But it also the story of the awakening consciousness of their children; the real heroine is the baby Flossie––she had a kick like &ldquo;White Mule&rdquo; whiskey––whose birth begins the book. Everything revolves around the baby and she is surely unique in literature. Dr. Williams was a pediatrician, and without sentimentality he makes of this little being, who cannot even talk, a full-scale, three-dimensional personality.</p>

<h2 id="slug-because-i-was-flesh">_slug: because-i-was-flesh</h2>

<p><em>Because I Was Flesh</em> is the story of Edward Dahlberg’s life as a child and young man, and a portrait in depth of the remarkable woman, his mother Lizzie, who shaped it. It is an authentic record from the inferno of modern city life, and a testament of American experience. Lizzie Dahlberg, separated from a worthless husband, works as a lady barber to keep herself and her son in shabby respectability amid the vice and brutality of Kansas City in the early 1900’s. Her constant objective: to acquire a new husband who can give her security and help educate the child. She is attractive to men, but fate never brings her a good one. One suitor makes her put the boy in an orphanage––years of torment that are brilliantly described––and then betrays her. Another does marry her––and disappears with her savings. Lizzie is in despair, but soon begins to laugh at life again and arches her bosom for the next prospect. As he grows through a sensitive, painful adolescence, Edward is both fascinated and appalled by his mother. He adores her but is ashamed of her. He tries to escape, bumming his way to Los Angeles and later going to college in Berkeley, but is always drawn back. Even her death, with which the book ends, cannot release him. Seldom has there been so ruthless, and yes so tender a dissection of the mother-son relationship. And from it Lizzie Dahlberg emerges as one of the unforgettable characters of modern literature.</p>

<p>Before his death, Dylan Thomas said of Vernon Watkins, &ldquo;I think him to be the most profound and greatly accomplished Welshman writing poems in English.” Since that time Watkins has published a series of distinguished volumes which have brought him to the forefront of contemporary English poets. This paperback selection is designed to bring the work of Vernon Watkins to the wide audience which it so well merits. The choice of poems has been made by the poet himself and is drawn from five earlier books, covering the period 1930-1960.

<p>William Carlos Williams’s medical practice and his literary career formed an undivided life. For forty years he was a busy doctor in the town of Rutherford, New Jersey, and yet he was able to write more than thirty books. One of the finest chapters in this <em>Autobiography</em> tells how each of his two roles stimulated and supported the other. We meet in these pages many of Williams’s friends: he writes with discerning frankness of the poets H.D., Ezra Pound, and Marianne Moore; of the artists Charles Demuth, Marsden Hartley, Charles Sheeler, and the photographer Alfred Stieglitz; and there are fine portraits of the writers who congregated in Paris in the Twenties: Joyce, Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and Ford Madox Ford. <em>The Autobiography</em> is an unpretentious book; it reads much as Williams talked––spontaneously and often with a special kind of salty humor. But it is a very human story, glowing with warmth and sensitivity. It brings us close to a rare man and lets us share his affectionate concern for the people to whom he ministered, body and soul, through a long rich life as physician and writer.</p>

<p>Charles Olson (1910-1970), described by William Carlos Williams as &ldquo;a major poet with a sweep of understanding of the world&rdquo; and who, as Joel Oppenheimer once wrote, &ldquo;brought two generations to life,&rdquo; stood as a bridge between the first leaders of the modern movement, such as Pound and Stein, and some of the most important later innovators (Denise Levertov acclaimed his work &ldquo;magnificent&rdquo;). This landmark collection, first published in 1967 and edited by his long-time friend Robert Creeley, includes poems from Olson’s superlative book, <em>The Distances</em>, as well as from his epic <em>Maximus Poems</em>. Also included are the entirety of the &ldquo;Mayan Letters,&rdquo; written to Creeley while Olson was in the Yucatan studying Mayan hieroglyphs; &ldquo;Appolonius of Tyana,&rdquo; a background script for an original dance play; and his ground-breaking manifesto on &ldquo;Projective Verse&rdquo; as well as other essential essays.</p>

<p>The Chilean poet Nicanor Parra is one of those significant figures who appear from time to time in all literatures and through a profound originality and sense of the Pound/Confucius principle of &ldquo;Make It New&rdquo; revitalize the poetry of their language. Just as the Imagists and William Carlos Williams rechannelled the course of American poetry, so Parra’s &ldquo;antipoems,&rdquo; with their directness of metaphor and rejection of rhetoric and &ldquo;poetic&rdquo; decoration, are influencing young poets throughout Latin America. &ldquo;Antipoetry,&rdquo; Parra has said, &ldquo;seeks to return poetry to its roots.&rdquo; The reader may judge from this collection, which is drawn from all of Parra’s published books, how well he has succeeded. Poems and Antipoems has been edited, with an introduction, by Miller Williams and presents Parra’s Spanish texts opposite the English versions which are by the editor, W. S. Merwin, Denise Levertov, Thomas Merton, William Carlos Williams, Allen Ginsberg, Fernando Alegria, J. Laughlin, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, who first discovered Parra for North American readers with a book in the City Lights series in 1960.</p>

<h2 id="slug-raids-on-the-unspeakable">_slug: raids-on-the-unspeakable</h2>

<p>This paperbook collection of his prose writings reveals the extent to which Thomas Merton moved from the other-worldly devotion of his earlier work to a direct, deeply engaged, often militant concern with the critical situation of man in the world. Here this concern finds expression in poetic irony and in meditations intentionally dour. In these brief, challenging pieces, Father Merton does not offer consolation or easy remedies. He looks candidly and without illusions at the world of the Sixties. Though he sees dark horizons, his ultimate answer is one of Christian hope. To vary the perspective, he writes in many forms, using parable and myth, the essay and the meditation, satire and manifesto, prose poetry and even adaptations from a medieval Arab mystic (Ibn Abbad) to humanize and dramatize his philosophical themes. The themes of Raids on the Unspeakable are as old as the myths of Prometheus and Atlas, and as new as Adolf Eichmann. They range from the &ldquo;Message&rdquo; written for an international congress of poets to the beautiful yet disturbing Christmas meditation, &ldquo;The Time of the End Is the Time of No Room.&rdquo; And there are essays inspired by the work of three significant contemporary writers: the late Flannery O’Connor, the French novelist Julien Green, and the playwright lonesco. A number of Father Merton’s own drawings are also included in the book — not as &ldquo;illustrations,&rdquo; but as &ldquo;signatures&rdquo; or &ldquo;abstract writings,&rdquo; which stand in their own right as another form of personal statement.</p>

<p>This volume brings together all of Kenneth Rexroth’s shorter poems from 1920 to the present, including a group of new poems written since the publication of <em>Natural Numbers</em>, drawn from seven earlier books. Among the American poets of the generation that came to prominence in the Forties, Kenneth Rexroth has been notable both for the independence of his personal voice and for his accessibility to the tradition of international avant-garde literature. He began writing and publishing in magazines at fifteen. His earliest work was personal and concrete, much like that of the Imagists. In his twenties he wrote in the disassociative style — sometimes called &ldquo;literary cubism &rdquo; — developed by Mallarmé, Apollinaire, and Reverdy. This was not free association, but the conscious disassociation and recombination of the elements of the poem to achieve the highest possible level of significance. With his later books Rexroth moved back to a direct and classically simple form of personal statement. In this period he wrote the great nature poems, the love poems, and the contemplative lyrics that have established his reputation as one of the most important American poets.</p>

<p>Cocteau’s novel <em>Les Enfants terribles</em>, which was first published in 1929, holds an undisputed place among the classics of modern fiction. Written in a French style that long defied successful translation––Cocteau was always a poet no matter what he was writing––the book came into its own for English-language readers in 1955 when the present version was completed by Rosamond Lehmann. It is a masterpiece of the art of translation of which <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em> said: &ldquo;It has the rare merit of reading as though it were an English original.&rdquo; Miss Lehmann was able to capture the essence of Cocteau’s strange, necromantic imagination and to bring fully to life in English his story of a brother and sister, orphaned in adolescence, who built themselves a private world out of one shared room and their own unbridled fantasies. What started in games and laughter became for Paul and Elisabeth a drug too magical to resist. The crime which finally destroyed them has the inevitability of Greek tragedy.</p>

Ambiguity, according to Mr. Empson, includes &ldquo;any verbal nuance, however slight, which gives room for alternative reactions to the same piece of language.&rdquo; From this definition, broad enough by his own admission sometimes to seem &ldquo;stretched absurdly far,&rdquo; he launches into a brilliant discussion, under seven classifications of differing complexity and depth, of such works, among others, as Shakespeare’s plays and the poetry of Chaucer, Donne, Marvell, Pope, Wordsworth, G. M. Hopkins, and T. S. Eliot.</p>

<p>The thirteen one-act plays collected in this volume include some of Tennessee Williams’s finest and most powerful work. They are full of the perception of life as it is, and the passion for life as it ought to be, which have made <em>The Glass Menagerie</em> and <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em> classics of the American theater. Only one of these plays (<em>The Purification</em>) is written in verse, but in all of them the approach to character is by way of poetic revelation. Whether Williams is writing of derelict roomers in a New Orleans boarding house (<em>The Lady of Larkspur Lotion</em>) or the memories of a venerable traveling salesman (<em>The Last of My Solid Gold Watches</em>) or of delinquent children (<em>This Property is Condemned</em>) his insight into human nature is that of the poet. He can compress the basic meaning of life — its pathos or its tragedy, its bravery or the quality of its love––into one small scene or a few moments of dialogue. Mr. Williams’s views on the role of the little theater in American culture are contained in a stimulating essay, &ldquo;Something wild…,” which serves as an introduction to this collection.</p>

<p>First published in 1935, <em>The Green Child</em> is Herbert Read’s only novel. But if he had written nothing else, this one inspired book would insure his fame. It is a utopian novel, a unique blend of reality and fantasy which moves from the English countryside to the South American pampas and then to a mysterious and eternal underground land of caves. In genre <em>The Green Child</em> is perhaps closest to the French conte philosophique, yet the word “philosophical&rdquo; suggests the abstruse whereas this is a very moving and exciting story, alive with the poetry of living and, at the same time, with a strange kind of other-worldly suspense. In his introduction Kenneth Rexroth speaks of the book’s “unearthly, hypnotic radiance,&rdquo; and Graham Greene has said of it: &ldquo;here Read conveys the private sense of glory, the same sense of glory that impelled Christian writers to picture the City of God.&rdquo; The late T.S. Eliot once told the publisher that he considered <em>The Green Child</em> to be one of the finest examples of English prose style of our century.</p>

In the 1950s, while working as a waiter at the Los Angeles Hilton, he met another erstwhile member of the Merchant Marine, Jack Kerouac, and soon thereafter both moved north to found, along with Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, and others, the San Francisco literary &ldquo;renaissance&rdquo; of the time. Kaufman promotes a spontaneous, prophetic verse, mixing street talk and jazz with vision. <em>Solitudes Crowded with Loneliness</em> contains odes to Charles Mingus, Hart Crane, Ray Charles, and Albert Camus as well as love lyrics, political rants, &ldquo;Prison Poems,&rdquo; and the prose meditation &ldquo;Second April.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For this volume, originally published in cloth in 1961, William Carlos Williams collected, and revised, four full-length plays and the libretto of an opera on George Washington. As might be expected of the man who did most in our time to create a new and truly &ldquo;American&rdquo; idiom for poetry, Dr. Williams’ writing for the stage challenges producers and actors to extend the range of modern drama. <em>Many Loves</em>, which ran for nearly a year (1959) in repertory at New York’s famous Living Theatre, explores four varieties of human attachment, while <em>A Dream of Love</em>, first produced in 1949, is a penetrating and poetic treatment of infidelity and marriage. <em>Tituba’s Children</em>, written three years before Arthur Miller’s <em>Crucible</em>, is a dramatic study of witch-hunting – the Salem trials of 1692 and McCarthyism in the 1950’s. <em>The First President</em> was first published in 1936. It is preceded by a long introduction on the theory of opera, the role of music, and the problems of realizing a historic figure on the stage. <em>The Cure</em> (1960) reminds us that Dr. Williams was for forty-two years a practicing physician. Its theme, developed in a very unusual situation, is the relationship between nurse and patient.</p>

<p>The 423 verses in the collection known as The Dhammapada (pada: &ldquo;the way&rdquo;; dhamma: &ldquo;the teaching&rdquo;; hence, &ldquo;The Path of Truth&rdquo;) are attributed to the Buddha himself and form the essence of the ethics of Buddhist philosophy. There are a number of English translations of The Dhammapada, but this version by Irving Babbitt, for many years professor at Harvard and founder, with Paul Elmer More, of the movement known as &ldquo;New Humanism,&rdquo; concentrates on the profound poetic quality of the verses and conveys, perhaps more than any other, much of the vitality of the original Pali text. Babbitt devoted many years to this translation––it was a labor of love. Together with his essay on &ldquo;Buddha and the Occident,&rdquo; which is also included in this edition, The Dhammapada was one of the basic components of his view of world history, a view which has influenced leaders of thought as diverse as Newton Arvin, Walter Lippmann, David Riesman and T. S. Eliot. Eliot, indeed, once wrote that &ldquo;to have been a student of Babbitt’s is to remain always in that position.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="slug-maldoror">_slug: maldoror</h2>

<p>The macabre but beautiful work, <em>Les Chants de Maldoror</em>, has achieved a considerable reputation as one of the earliest and most extraordinary examples of Surrealist writing. It is a long narrative prose poem which celebrates the principle of Evil in an elaborate style and with a passion akin to religious fanaticism. The French poet-critic Georges Hugnet has written of Lautréamont: &ldquo;He terrifies, stupefies, strikes dumb. He could look squarely at that which others had merely given a passing glance.&rdquo; Little is known of the author of <em>Maldoror</em>, Isidore Ducasse, self-styled Comte de Lautréamont, except that he was born in Montevideo, Uruguay in 1846 and died in Paris at the age of twenty-four. When first published in 1868-9, Maldoror went almost unnoticed. But in the nineties the book was rediscovered and hailed as a work of genius by such eminent writers as Huysmans, Léon Bloy, Maeterlinck, and Rémy de Gourmont. Later still, Lautréamont was to be canonized as one of their principal &ldquo;ancestors&rdquo; by the Paris Surrealists. This edition, translated by Guy Wernham, includes also a long introduction to a never-written, or now lost, volume of poetry. Thus, except for a few letters, it gives all the surviving literary work of Lautréamont.</p>

Sam soon finds himself involved––all the while with his finger stuck fast in an ale bottle––with a fantastic and whimsical assortment of odd characters whom only Dylan Thomas could have conceived.</p>

<p>This anthology is Ezra Pound’s own choice of the poetry of various ages and cultures––ranging from his translations of the Confucian Odes up to E. E. Cummings––which he considered the finest of its type. It is a statement by example of the &ldquo;Pound critical canon&rdquo; and, as such, a short course in the history of world poetry, useful alike for the student and the general reader. Nearly a hundred poets are represented, a number of them in Pound’s own translations, with emphasis on the Greek and Latin, Chinese, Troubadour, Renaissance, and Elizabethan. Of particular interest are the notes on certain of the poems and poets which Pound supplied in comment on his selections.</p>

<p>Some of the most rewarding pages in Henry Miller’s books concern his self-education as a writer. He tells, as few great writers ever have, how he set his goals, how he discovered the excitement of using words, how the books he read influenced him, and how he learned to draw on his own experience. For this collection––which should be invaluable to young writers––Thomas H. Moore, co-founder of the Henry Miller Literary Society, brought together, with Miller’s active collaboration, the most revealing passages on the art and practice of writing. A number of them are from unpublished manuscripts; there are private notations, writing schedules, outlines of ideas.</p>

<p>The wonderful world of classical Indian drama has been obscured for most readers by the stilted style of the existing 19th-century translations. Here, an Indian Sanskrit scholar, P. Lal, who is also a fine poet in his own right, has produced new versions in modern idiom which brings across the full richness and vitality of the originals. And these &ldquo;transcreations&rdquo; are so presented that they will &ldquo;play&rdquo; on our stage today. The volume contains: <em>Shakuntala</em> by Kalidasa, <em>The Toy Cart</em> by King Shudraka, <em>The Signet Ring of Rakshasa</em> by Vishakadatta, <em>The Dream of Vasavadatta</em> by Bhasa, <em>The Later Story of Rama</em> by Bhavabhuti, and <em>Ratnavali</em> by Harsha. Professor Lal (Xavier College, Calcutta) has provided an introduction on the history and aesthetic theory of Sanskrit drama, individual prefaces for each play, a phonetic guide to the pronunciation of the Indian names, and a selective bibliography.</p>

<p>One of the great classics of Indian culture is the <em>Shilappadikaram</em>, or <em>Lay of The Ankle Bracelet</em>, a verse romance in the ancient Tamil language which is attributed to Ilangô Adigal, a Jain prince of the Third Century AD. This is a tale of wonders and misfortunes, of hapless mortals and capricious deities, of magic and heroism in a bright but also cruel world in which the law of Karma rules: “actions committed in past lives must always bear fruit.&rdquo; Thus the peerless young Kôvalan will leave his loyal wife Kannaki for the courtesan Midhavi, and though he returns to her, still meets his death because of her ill-omened ankle bracelet. The <em>Shilappadikaram</em> has been called all epic and even a novel, but it is also a book of general education. llangô packed his story with information: history merging into myth, religious rites, caste customs, military lore, descriptions of city or country life. And four Cantos are little anthologies of the poetry of the period (seashore and mountain songs, hunters’ and milkmaids’ songs). Thus the <em>Shilappadikaram</em> gives us a vivid picture of early Indian life in all its aspects.</p>

<p>Wilfred Owen’s death in World War I was an irreparable loss to English poetry. His war poems, most of which were composed in a thirteen-month period on the front line, have kept their originality and force through the past seventy years. The best of them are considered the finest poems about war in the English language. This definitive edition of Owen’s poetry, based on a close study of the manuscript sources in the British Museum and elsewhere, contains a selection of the poet’s juvenilia and several other unpublished poems, as well as those which have appeared in the editions edited by Siegfried Sassoon and Edmund Blunden.</p>

<p>It is autumn in Poland, but an unnatural autumn. Upon the city pours a strange storm, hot winds raising the dust, clouds blackening the sky. Through feverish days three persons &ndash; a husband, a wife, and a lover &ndash; stalk one another, jealously scorching them like the wind. Where is the betrayal happening? Can the informer be believed? They pursue a maddening dance as the storm rises, and their horror, as they know well, will be allayed only by the greater horror of the truth. Widmar, the aging husband; his wife Rebecca, with her enigmatic, byzantine beauty; and the surgeon, Dr. Tamten: these three enact a hallucinated triangle. It is, as Widmar remarks, a question of ethics, the medical variety versus those of ordinary men. In certain circumstances the doctor is permitted to deceive his patient, but how far may the deceit be driven? Under the operating room’s white lights the conflict reaches its climax. Jealousy and Medicine is recognized as the finest novel by one of Poland’s outstanding modern writers. First published in 1932, it pioneered new fictional techniques, particularly in a use of distortion and fragmented time sequence which may have been inspired by modern painting. Jealousy and Medicine won the Polish Academy of Literature Prize and has been translated into fifteen languages. This English version by Eileen Arthurton-Barker marks its first publication in the United States.</p>

<p>These fourteen stories are the work of a writer whose exploitation of the language for artistic effect is extraordinary. The visionary, the poetic, the humorous and the surrealistic inform each story, and yet there is no terror merely without responsible intelligence. A maiden lady steals from a bank to buy gifts for a goat which appears at night outside her window; a young married couple &ldquo;adjust&rdquo; to our world of time payments and credit; a writer makes his living by selling parts of his own body to unsuspecting insurance companies; a &ldquo;bandit&rdquo; is obsessed by the contents of freezers, and steals to feed a river; a doctor takes his dying, extroverted old father away from the home place, and in the process sees the first intimations of his own death. We see the &ldquo;have nots,&rdquo; the middle class, artists and professors all caught in worlds they do not fully apprehend. Taken together these stories present a complex view of a hard world.</p>

<p>In her introduction to this remarkable book if fables and drawings, Denise Levertov describes Russel Edson as &ldquo;one of those originals who appear out of the lonesomeness of a vast, throned country to create a peculiar and defined world &hellip; a world seen as through the wrong end of a spyglass, miniscule but singularly clear.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fable&rdquo; is really too narrow a term for Russel Edsons’s writing. His brief, tightly-packed, highly-charged paragraphs are the crystallized essence of what could be long stories, and they are prose poems. They are nutshell commentaries on the human condition (&ldquo;at times wildly funny, as if King Lear had been written and illustrated by Edward Lear&rdquo;) and they are ontological probings into the nature of things: objects, animals, people. &ldquo;Edson’s mode,&rdquo; Miss Levertov writes, &ldquo;is detached, oblique, austere. He is able to pass without loss of grace from the hilarious to a kind of dark gothick beauty, and sometimes to a tenderness that reveals him as no cruel puppetmaster but the anguished beholder of inexplicable cruelties. His art &ndash; its syntax, its elegant dryness, its bizarre condensed events &ndash; is the unique outgrowth of an eccentric imagination, the convoluted shell of the mind’s hypersensitive, clairvoyant snail.&rdquo; Edson’s line drawings are not specific illustrations to his tales, but a kind of contrasting commentary, or obbligato to them.</p>

<p>With this collection of stories by Tommaso Landolfi, drawn from his volumes published in Italy over the last 25 years, New Directions is proud to be able to introduce here one of the most extraordinary writers of our day. Much admired in Europe, Landolfi has been called &ldquo;the Italian Kafka&rdquo;; he is often linked with the Surrealists, and in the intellectual quality of his fantasy there are certain affinities with Borges; but beyond these superficial comparisons, his is a truly unique––and fascinating––art. It is based in a prodigious imagination, a very curious sense of humor and a rare command of irony. The translations are by Raymond Rosenthal, John Longrigg and Wayland Young.</p>

<h2 id="slug-stephen-hero">_slug: stephen-hero</h2>

<p>Stephen Hero is an early version of Joyce’s famous <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em>. It was originally rejected on grounds of indecency––so the story goes––by twenty publishers, whereupon Joyce threw the manuscript in the fire, but Mrs. Joyce rescued several unburnt portions. Although Joyce later entirely rewrote his novel of a young Irishman’s rebellion against church, country and family, this early version is beautifully composed, the mood being more discursive and personal than in <em>A Portrait</em>. Many episodes later cut for the sake of good novelistic form, especially autobiographical episodes of sensual and family life, are fully presented, with some of the most vivacious dialogue Joyce ever wrote. Between them, the two versions give us a clear example of Joyce’s literary development as well as many details of his life.</p>

<p>A seacoast, a village, summer in Wales—what are they made of? One day the sea clambers among the rocks like children at play, gulls drift on the air, the ancient houses are inhabited by people in whose lilting speech myths still live. The next day rocks and gnarled trees taunt a black wind, houses are dark with suspicion, the people brandish their poverty, fanaticism, and studied discourtesies. These are not contrasts, but contradictions. With this vivid novel Norman Thomas makes his debut. Like his hero, he is a young Californian with a welsh background; and his skill in adapting his speech and mythology of Wales inevitably suggests comparison with that other Thomas, Dylan (who was no relation). If the two resemble one another, however, it is only as collateral descendants of a common literary ancestor. Norman Thomas speaks in his own voice in this superbly-written novel, a voice that will sound in the reader’s ear long after the book has ended.</p>

<p>This practical guidebook to the work of Virginia Woolf gives the student or lay reader the essential information about Mrs. Woolf’s life and writings, together with a critical summary of her method and achievement. Professor Daiches, author of A Critical History of English Literature and Director of The School of English and American Studies at The University of Sussex, discusses the major books in turn, analyzing their structure and intention. He traces Virginia Woolf’s evolution—technical and spiritual—as an artist, emphasizing the successive experiments that made her one of the most important innovators of the modern English novel. By use of extensive quotation from the books themselves, Professor Daiches allows Mrs. Woolf to tell much of her own story. For this revised edition, the author has written a new introduction and the bibliography has been brought up to date.</p>

<h2 id="slug-revolt-in-aspromonte">_slug: revolt-in-aspromonte</h2>

<p>This short but powerful novel of peasant life in Calabria is recognized by Italians as one of the classics of their modern literature. Alvaro, who died in 1956, is frequently compared to Verga, and <em>Revolt in Aspromonte</em> is as moving, as touchingly human as Verga’s <em>Under the Medlar Tree</em>. <em>Revolt in Aspromonte</em> is the story of the shepherd Argiro and his family––of their struggle for survival, and some shred of dignity, against the degrading oppression of the feudal family which controls their village. In his despair, Argiro believes that if only he can educate his youngest son, Benedetto, to be a priest he will achieve status and revenge on those who have wronged him. To this end, he sacrifices himself and the gentle older brother, Antonello. A simple tale––but told with a poetry of style which gives it a somber beauty.</p>

John Hawkes, in his search for a means to transcend outworn modes of fictional realism, has discovered a a highly original technique for objectifying the perennial degradation of mankind within a context of fantasy&hellip;. Nowhere has the nightmare of human terror and the deracinated sensibility been more consciously analyzed than in <em>The Cannibal</em>. Yet one is aware throughout that such analysis proceeds only in terms of a resolutely committed humanism.&rdquo; ––Hayden Carruth</p>

<p>This study is not literary criticism but a fascinating chapter in Miller’s own spiritual autobiography. The social function of the creative personality is a recurrent theme with Henry Miller, and this book is perhaps his most poignant and concentrated analysis of the artist’s dilemma. &ldquo;In Rimbaud,&rdquo; writes Miller, &ldquo;I see myself as in a mirror.&rdquo; The discovery of the French poet’s ecstasy and sense of horror, of his startling use of language, opened new worlds to Miller. An immediate identification was established. Here was another wanderer, a man both in the world and outside it, another spirit in revolt who was caught in a destiny difficult to define and surmount.</p>

<p>Some writers attempt to conceal the literary influences which have shaped their thinking––but not Henry Miller. In this unique work, he gives an utterly candid and self-revealing account of the reading he did during his formative years. In <em>The Books in My Life</em> he shares the thrills of discovery that many kinds of books have brought to a keenly curious and questioning mind. Some of Miller’s favorite writers are the giants whom most of us revere––authors such as Dostoyevsky, Boccaccio, Walt Whitman, James Joyce, Thomas Mann, Lao-Tse. To them he brings fresh and penetrating insights. But many are lesser-known figures: Krishnamurti, the prophet-sage; the French contemporaries Blaise Cendrars and Jean Giono; Richard Jeffries, who wrote <em>The Story of My Heart</em>; the Welshman John Cowper Powys; and scores of others. <em>The Books in My Life</em> contains some fine autobiographical chapters, too. Miller describes his boyhood in Brooklyn, when he devoured the historical stories of G. A. Henty and the romances of Rider Haggard. He tells of the men and women whom he regards as &ldquo;living books&rdquo;: Lou Jacobs, W. E. B. DuBois, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and others. He offers his reminiscences of the New York Theatre in the early 1900’s––including plays such as <em>Alias Jimmy Valentine</em> and <em>Nellie, the Beautiful Cloak Model</em>. And finally, in Miller’s best vein of humor, he provides a satiric chapter on bathroom reading. In an appendix, Miller lists the hundred books that have influenced him most.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything is written in blood, but a blood that is saturated with starlight. You can look clean through him and see the planets wheeling. The silence he creates is deafening. It takes you back to the beginning of the world, to that hush which is engraved on the face of mystery.&rdquo; So writes Henry Miller of Blaise Cendrars in his foreword to this collection of prose and poetry by one of the great figures of modern French literature. Swiss-born in 1887, but French to the core in spirit, Cendrars roamed the world for many years, a restless seeker who made life an adventure and his novels and poems the record of a never-satisfied appetite for human experience. As a young man he reached the Orient across Russia, and &ldquo;The Transsiberian,&rdquo; one of his finest long poems is included in this volume. Over the years, a number of Cendrars’ works were translated into English––early among them, in 1931, John Dos Passos’ brilliant version of &ldquo;Panama, or the Adventures of My Seven Uncles&rdquo; (reprinted in this collection)––but all are now out of print here, so that this selection from the whole range of Cendrars is most timely. It has been prepared by Professor Walter Albert of Brandeis University, whose long introductory essay is the most detailed biographical and critical study of Cendrars now available in English. While the greater part of the selection is concentrated on Cendrars’ poetry (with the French text printed en face), there are also representative excerpts from the major novels and other prose books, as well as several essays, including impressions of Chagall and Picasso. The translations are by Walter Albert, John Dos Passos, Scott Bates, and H. L. Stuart.</p>

<p>Rohini, the slim and sloe-eyed young widow, defied the code of the Hindu elders. Though her husband was dead, she still wore her golden bangles and sang as she carried her jar to the well, moving altogether too gracefully, the villagers complained &ndash; for the husbands of others were still decidedly alive! Including handsome Govindlal, whose wife Bhramar was a jewel, but what could she do against Rohini’s enticements? And then when Rohini was caught in a conspiracy to forge the last will and testament of wealthy old Krishnakanta &hellip; . Such timeless themes &ndash; the passions, betrayals and conflicts that have inspired all storytelling since the art began &ndash; compose this novel of life in India at the end of the last century. But this was also a period of dramatic social change as Hindu orthodoxy gave ground to Western ideas. Young girls doomed to lovelessness by the laws forbidding the remarriage of widows were no longer ready to accept their fate with resignation. Bankim-chandra Chatterjee, the acknowledged master of the Bengali novel, spins his tale with simplicity and shrewd humor. And the translation by J.C. Ghosh vividly transmits the rich and varied colors of traditional Indian life.</p>

<p>This collection of stories and essays takes its title from a long prose reverie in which Henry Miller, after his return to the United States, thinks back to the happy years of middle life which he spent in France. The qualities that make the French unique have seldom been so movingly expressed. The America he had rediscovered does not come off very well by contrast—particularly the Hollywood state of mind, which gets a thoroughly Milleresque going over in the burlesque &ldquo;Astrological Fricassee.&rdquo; What Miller likes on the American scene are the individuals who have broken through the pattern of conformity, the rare and often isolated creative personalities who are resisting the dehumanization of our so-called “civilization.” He gives us vivid portraits of the painters Abe Rattner, Jean Varda and Beauford Delaney; the sculptor Bufano; and Jasper Deeter, director of the hedgerow Theatre. Two of Henry Miller’s greatest essays are also in this volume: &ldquo;Murder the Murderer&rdquo; (on war), a declaration which ranks with Randolph Bourne’s War and the Intellectuals, and, with particular relevance to the censorship codes which kept his <em>Tropics of Cancer</em> and <em>Capricorn</em> out of this country for so long, &ldquo;Obscenity and the Law of Reflection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For forty-two years the poet William Carlos Williams was a practicing physician in a typical American town in New Jersey. And, as Van Wyck Brooks points out in his introduction to this collection of Dr. Williams’ stories, the doctor &ldquo;did not treat a man [only] as something to which surgery and drugs applied&rdquo; but &ldquo;as material for a work of art.&rdquo; This point of view produced a dozen or more stories which are true masterpieces, and in all of Williams’ stories there is a vitality and an immediacy unique in American fiction. This volume gathers together fifty-two stories from earlier books, <em>The Knife of the Times</em> (1932), <em>Life Along the Passaic River</em> (1938), and <em>Make Light of It</em> (1950), and includes as well the great long story, <em>The Farmers’ Daughters</em>, completed in 1956.</p>

<p>An English horse race, the Golden Bowl at Aldington, provides the background for John Hawkes’ exciting novel, <em>The Lime Twig</em>, which tells of an ingenious plot to steal and race a horse under a false name. But it would be unfair to the reader to reveal what happens when a gang of professional crooks gets wind of the scheme and moves to muscle in on this bettors’ dream of a long-odds situation. Worked out with all the meticulous detail, terror, and suspense of a nightmare, the tale is, on one level, comparable to a Graham Greene thriller; on another, it explores a group of people, their relationships fears, and loves. For as Leslie A. Fiedler says in his introduction, &ldquo;John Hawkes.. . makes terror rather than love the center of his work, knowing all the while, of course, that there can be no terror without the hope for love and love’s defeat &hellip; .&rdquo;</p>

<p>A chronicle of violent fury and compassion, written when Surrealism was still vigorous and doing battle with psychotic &ldquo;reality,&rdquo; <em>The Journal of Albion Moonlight</em> is an American monument to engagement.</p>

<h2 id="slug-nikolai-gogol">_slug: nikolai-gogol</h2>

<p>The work of Gogol—one of the greatest of Russia’s literary geniuses—has become fairly well known in America but has seldom been understood. There have been many unfortunate translations of his work in English and few good ones. Critics have often tried to label him “the Russian Dickens” or viewed him as a forerunner of our own literary champions of the oppressed. In this brilliant study, Vladimir Nabokov shows us that Gogol’s comedy was not Dickensian, but biting and salty, textured throughout by a use of the irrational not duplicated by any other writer; that in the play <em>The Government Inspector</em> and <em>Dead Souls</em>, a novel, his depiction of the frauds of bureaucracy and the vagaries of Russian serf-owners were not so much intended to hasten social change as to serve as a framework for displaying the fantasies of the human spirit. Nabokov, whose own uniqueness is known through his many novels, brings the singularity of Gogol’s genius to life—the strange, unhappy, self-deluding man and his extraordinary literary methods and achievements.</p>

<p>Denise Levertov is surely one of the most impressive of the younger poets writing in English today. Her earlier books (<em>Here and Now</em>, <em>Overland to the Islands</em>, <em>With Eyes at the Back of Our Heads</em>) were notable on several counts: technically, for her fine ear and her skill with free but controlled forms; in their substance, for the intensity––and clarity––of her very personal vision. These qualities persist in <em>The Jacob’s Ladder</em>, and to them has been added––particularly in the powerful sequence on themes suggested by the Eichmann trial––a larger social concern, a more penetrating identification with the great problems of humanity. In addition, thirteen poems from the now out-of-print earlier volume <em>Overland to the Islands</em> are included by courtesy of Jonathan Williams, the original publisher.</p>

<h2 id="slug-dostoevksy">_slug: dostoevksy</h2>

<p>Gide’s critical study of Dostoevsky, published here in its entirety in English for the first time, was one of the first of Gide’s books to be translated. Back in 1924 the London publisher commissioned an introductory note from Arnold Bennett, then at the height of his popularity, who wrote: &ldquo;I can recall no other critical work which more cogently justifies and more securely established its subject&hellip; . It is impossible to read this Dostoevsky without enlarging one’s ideas of Dostoevsky and of the functions of the novel. This note is here reprinted and for the New Directions Paperbook edition a missing essay on The Brothers Karamazov (newly translated by Louise Varèse) is added, as is an introduction by Professor Albert J. Guerard, formerly of Harvard and now of Stanford University. Noting the rise in reputation of both Dostoevsky and Gide in the interim, some of it the result of the influence of this book, Mr. Guerard writes &ldquo;&hellip; if I could keep only one book on Dostoevsky I would be tempted to keep this one. It conveys &hellip; the excitement of intensely personal and sympathetic reading and the shock of recognition.&rdquo; André Gide, the French Protestant moralist and &ldquo;corrupter of youth,&rdquo; who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1947 and died in apotheosis as the leading modern French critic and &ldquo;the embodied consciousness of an epoch,&rdquo; had planned to write a life of Dostoevsky, until then considered an &ldquo;incomprehensible monster&rdquo; in the non-Russian world. Instead he delivered a series of lectures which formed the basis for this book. A labor of love, it becomes a guidebook to the soul of the Russian genius. As much as a plumbing of the moral depths of the dark and terrible side of human nature as a discussion of Dostoevsky the novelist, it also is a reflection of Gide himself, for he emphasizes the paradoxes, the multiple contradictions, the ethic in Dostoevsky which were uppermost in his own view of life and literature.</p>

<p><em>The Wisdom of the Desert</em> was one of Thomas Merton’s favorites among his own books — surely because he had hoped to spend his last years as a hermit. The personal tone of the translations, the blend of reverence and humor so characteristic of him, show how deeply Merton identified with the legendary authors of these sayings and parables, the fourth-century Christian Fathers who sought solitude and contemplation in the deserts of the Near East. The hermits of Scete who turned their backs on a corrupt society remarkably like our own had much in common with the Zen Master of China and Japan, and Father Merton made his selection from them with an eye to the kind of impact produced by the Zen mondo.</p>

<p>In this selection of stories and essays, Henry Miller elucidates, revels, and soars, showing his command over a wide range of moods, styles, and subject matters. Writing “from the heart,” always with a refreshing lack of reticence, Miller involves the reader directly in his thoughts and feelings. “His real aim,” Karl Shapiro has written, “is to find the living core of our world whenever it survives and in whatever manifestation, in art, in literature, in human behavior itself. It is then that he sings, praises, and shouts at the top of his lungs with the uncontainable hilarity he is famous for.”</p>

<p>Here are some of Henry Miller’s best-known writings: an essay on the photographer Brassai; “Reflections on Writing,” in which Miller examines his own position as a writer; “Seraphita” and “Balzac and His Double,” on the works of other writers; and “The Alcoholic Veteran,” “Creative Death,” “The Enormous Womb,” and “The Philosopher Who Philosophizes.”</p>

<p>&ldquo;A surreal semi-autobiographical blackbook record of a semi-mad period of my life, in that mindless, timeless state most romantics pass through, confusing flesh madonnas with spiritual ones.&rdquo; This is how the author describes this extraordinary expatriate novel. &ldquo;To all those who have for several years sought to discredit the new American literature, Lawrence Ferlinghetti has just dealt a most powerful blow,&rdquo; wrote French critic Pierre Lepape in 1961 when <em>Her</em> was published in France as <em>La Quatrième Personne du Singulier</em>. Calling it &ldquo;a masterpiece of the young American novel,&rdquo; Lepape declared it was &ldquo;the confirmation of a great American writer who, in the hall of American literary glories, takes the place left vacant by the death of Hemingway.&rdquo; Lepape went on to speak of the &ldquo;incredible verbal virtuosity&rdquo; by which the reader is led through this &ldquo;laby-rêve,&rdquo; and it is this image of the &ldquo;labyrinth-dream&rdquo; which relates <em>Her</em> to the anti-novels of the young French school of Robbe-Grillet and Butor.</p>

<p>The young poet Gregory Corso has been much publicized as one of the leading literary spokesmen for the “Beat Generation,” together with Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William Burroughs. It is true that he has been one of the inner circle of the “Beats” from the first, but many admirers of his poetry feel that it belongs quite as much to other and older traditions in world literature. One of these is the revival of pure poetry whenever an “original”––be it Rimbaud or Whitman––has broken with current verse conventions to give free rein to the magic of language. Another is that ancient pre-occupation of poets––the sense of the immediacy of death. Like Villon or Dylan Thomas, Corso lives close to the mystery of death. It is, perhaps, his central theme, on which variations ranging from the terrible to the comic are sounded. But Corso is seldom macabre. A bursting vitality always carries him back to the sensations of the living, though always it is the reality behind the obvious which has caught his eye. “How I love to probe life,” Corso has written, “That’s what poetry is to me, a wondrous prober… It’s not the metre or measure of a line, a breath; not ‘law’ music; but the assembly of great eye sounds placed into an inspired measured idea.”</p>

<p>One of the first books to sum up the contribution of James Joyce, this volume remains an essential guide to the works of a great innovator of modern literature. Because Harry Levin’s view is large, as opposed to the many necessary exegeses and close textual studies, he leads the reader easily into the delights to be found in Joyce, from the comparatively simple prose of <em>Dubliners</em>, through <em>Ulysses</em> and into the complexities of <em>Finnegans Wake</em>. The insight and brilliance of this &ldquo;critical introduction,&rdquo; first published by New Directions in 1941, make it as rewarding for the expert as the student. For this revised edition, Mr. Levin, who is Irving Babbitt Professor of Comparative Literature at Harvard, has made revisions and added a new preface and a long &ldquo;postscript&rdquo; which he calls &ldquo;Revising Joyce.&rdquo; He examines the works that have come to light in the last few years and some of the important later biographical writings about Joyce.</p>

Into Polo’s remarkably objective report Mr. Collis, author of The Land of the Great Image and a Far East expect who has himself traveled over much of Polo’s route, has interwoven his own commentary and explanation to provide a much broader, more modern perspective. The result is a panoramic, authentic picture of 13th Century Asia as well as a lively portrait of the incredible Polo and a journey which remains as astonishing as any that history records.</p>

<p>Harry Levin’s <em>Memories of the Moderns</em>, originally published by New Directions in 1980, is now presented in New Directions Paperbook format. This gathering of prose pieces––reviews, essays, lectures, introductions, personal recollections, and epistles, written for the most part during the 1970s––combines criticism with reminiscence and is both an exploration of the idea of modernism within the international frame of comparative literature and a valediction. By now, what was so avant-garde, experimental, difficult, and sometimes shocking in the writings of the twentieth-century modernists has permanently altered our literature––the groundbreakers have become our classics. Discussed here are Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, Heinrich and Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos, William Carlos Williams, Conrad Aiken, Jean-Paul Sartre (writing on Flaubert), Francis Ponge, W. H. Auden, Delmore Schwartz, Randall Jarrell, I. A. Richards, Edmund Wilson, Vladimir Nabokov, and F. O. Mathiessen. There is as well an opening letter to James Laughlin, who published Harry Levin’s seminal book on James Joyce in 1941.</p>

<p>Miss Levertov’s third book of poetry, <em>With Eyes at the Back of Our Heads</em>, is now reissued as a paperbook. M. L. Rosenthal said of it, &ldquo;She gives it’s a world of awakened, contemplated selfhood,&rdquo; and Donald Hall: &ldquo;She handles the movement of free verse with consistent brilliance.&rdquo; The collection opens with a translation from an ancient Toltec Codex, a poem on The Artist. &ldquo;The true artist,’’ wrote the Toltec poet, ’’maintains dialogue with his heart, meets things with his mind.’’ Heart and mind are wonderfully evident in Denise Levertov’s poems––heart in the intensity of feeling, mind in the vigor and clarity of her statements. Sensitivity… delicacy without softness… a kind of imagination which eliminates all but the essence… a metric which conceals the strict discipline which gives it its grace––these are a few of the qualities that distinguish the work of Denise Levertov and make her one of the most impressive among the younger poets writing today.</p>

<p>Fifteen of the most celebrated plays of the Noh theatre repertory are given here in their entirety and five more are presented in synopsis. The translations are grounded in a critical discussion of the Noh theatre, its history and place in the court life of Japan, a description of the stage on which it is performed, its music, costumes, and masks, and the dance which is usually the high point of the performance. Both Pound and Fenollosa discuss the special elements of Noh poetry, and Pound’s poetic organization of Fenollosa’s authoritative translation and notes creates a fortunate collaboration.</p>

<p><em>Confessions of a Mask</em> tells the story of Kochan, an adolescent boy tormented by his burgeoning attraction to men: he wants to be &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; Kochan is meek-bodied and unable to participate in the more athletic activities of his classmates. He begins to notice his growing attraction to some of the boys in his class, particularly the pubescent body of his friend Omi. To hide his homosexuality, he courts a woman, Sonoko, but this exacerbates his feelings for men. As news of the war reaches Tokyo, Kochan considers the fate of Japan and his place within its deeply rooted propriety.
<em>Confessions of a Mask</em> reflects Mishima&rsquo;s own coming of age in post-war Japan. Its publication in English – praised by Gore Vidal, James Baldwin, and Christopher Isherwood – propelled the young Yukio Mishima to international fame.</p>

<p>The awarding of the 1958 Nobel Prize for Literature to Boris Pasternak and the subsequent calumny of his fellow citizens in Soviet Russia focused unusual attention on Pasternak’s great novel, <em>Dr. Zhivago</em>, and the small body of his other work. At that time, the latter was only available (in any language, as far as is known) in New Directions’ <em>Selected Writings of Pasternak</em>, first published in 1949. The 1958 edition was issued with a new introduction by Babette Deutsch under the title of the book’s main component, Pasternak’s autobiography. Written when Pasternak was forty, <em>Safe Conduct</em> puzzled many readers in Russia and when it appeared in English, because its isolated sharp impressions and its juxtapositions seemed to deny chronology, but at least one critic recognized it as “the most original of autobiographies, employing a new technique of great importance.” Also included is a group of remarkable short stories, translated by Robert Payne, dealing with the mysteries of life and art, and a selection of the poems that have made Pasternak known, to the few at least, as the “outstanding Russian poet of the century.” These are translated by the British critic and poet, C. M. Bowra, and by Miss Deutsch.</p>

<p>Baudelaire’s _Les_ <em>Fleurs du Mal</em>, which in successive editions contained all of his published poems, has for over a hundred years now opened new vistas for man’s imagination and quickened the sensibilities of poets everywhere. The greatest French poet of the 19th century, Baudelaire was also the first truly modern poet, and his direct and indirect influence on the literature of our time has been immeasurable. </p>

<p>Here in this volume are selections from _Les _<em>Fleurs du Mal</em> as chosen by Marthiel and Jackson Mathews from their complete bilingual edition  published by New Directions in 1955 — “undoubtedly the best single collection of Baudelaire’s verse in English” (<em>St. Louis Post Dispatch</em>).</p>

<p><em>Flowers of Evil: A Selection</em> contains fifty-three poems which the Mathews feel best represent the total work and which have been most successfully rendered into English. The French texts as established by Yves Gerard Le Dantec for the Pleiade edition are printed en face. Included are Baudelaire’s “Three Drafts of a Preface” and brief notes on the nineteen translators whose works is represented.</p>

<p>The prose poems of the great French Symbolist, Arthur Rimbaud (1854-1891), have acquired enormous prestige among readers everywhere and have been a revolutionary influence on poetry in the twentieth century. They are offered here both in their original texts and in superb English translations by Louise Varèse. Mrs. Varèse first published her versions of Rimbaud’s <em>Illuminations</em> in 1946. Since then she has revised her work and has included two poems which in the interim have been reclassified as part of <em>Illuminations</em>. This edition also contains two other series of prose poems, which include two poems only recently discovered in France, together with an introduction in which Miss Varèse discusses the complicated ins and outs of Rimbaldien scholarship and the special qualities of Rimbaud’s writing. Rimbaud was indeed the most astonishing of French geniuses. Fired in childhood with an ambition to write, he gave up poetry before he was twenty-one. Yet he had already produced some of the finest examples of French verse. He is best known for <em>A Season in Hell</em>, but his other prose poems are no less remarkable. While he was working on them he spoke of his interest in hallucinations––&rdquo;des vertiges, des silences, des nuits.&rdquo; These perceptions were caught by the poet in a beam of pellucid, and strangely active language which still lights up––now here, now there––unexplored aspects of experience and thought.</p>

<p>Ezra Pound has been called &ldquo;the inventor of modern poetry in English.&rdquo; The verse and criticism which he produced during the early years of this century very largely determined the directions of creative writing in our time; and virtually every major poet in England and America today has acknowledged his help or influence. Pound’s lyric genius, his superb technique, and his fresh insight into literary problems make him one of the small company of men who through the centuries have kept poetry alive, one of the great innovators. For the reader who is still unacquainted with Pound’s work, this book offers a compact yet representative selection of his poems and translations. The span covered is Pound’s entire writing career, from his early lyrics and the translations of Provençal songs to his recent English version of Sophokles’ <em>Trachiniae</em>. Included are parts of his best known works — the Chinese translations, the sequence called <em>Hugh Selwyn Mauberley</em>, the <em>Homage to Sextus Properitus</em>. <em>The Cantos</em>, Pound’s major epic, are presented in generous selections, chosen to emphasize the main themes of the whole poem. Here, in short, is the indispensable minimum. Students and general readers alike will find it their best introduction to Ezra Pound and the poetry of the twentieth century.</p>

Whence Henry Miller’s title for this, one of his most appealing books; first published in 1957, it tells the story of Miller’s life on the Big Sur, a section of the California coast where he lived for fifteen years. Big Sur is the portrait of a place—one of the most colorful in the United States—and of the extraordinary people Miller knew there: writers (and writers who did not write), mystics seeking truth in meditation (and the not-so-saintly looking for sex-cults or celebrity), sophisticated children and adult innocents; geniuses, cranks and the unclassifiable, like Conrad Moricand, the “Devil in Paradise” who is one of Miller’s greatest character studies. Henry Miller writes with a buoyancy and brimming energy that are infectious. He has a fine touch for comedy. But this is also a serious book—the testament of a free spirit who has broken through the restraints and clichés of modern life to find within himself his own kind of paradise.</p>

<h2 id="slug-faust">_slug: faust</h2>

<p>There have been many previous translations of Goethe’s <em>Faust</em>, and particularly of <em>Part I</em>, but for one reason or another all have failed to give, at least for the modern reader, a direct impression of the power and universal appeal of this “greatest masterwork of German literature.” C. F. Maclntyre, scholar, translator and poet, worked five years and then, as a Guggenheim Fellow, went to Germany to consult leading Goethe authorities there, in order to make his translation the most faithful possible to the original: but his foremost aim was to provide a text that was readable and cast in the living speech of our country and time. That he succeeded magnificently has been attested by individuals like Aldous Huxley, by critics, students and general readers. Goethe said that all his works were “one long confession,” and certainly into <em>Faust</em>, on which he worked sixty years, he welded his own search for the meaning of existence and of the soul. From the wager between God and Mephistopheles and the pact Faust makes with the latter—that this genial, urbane devil could have his soul if ever Faust became satisfied with any experience or knowledge Mephistopheles could show him—the drama unfolds in scenes that are human and compelling, that hold the reader by their despair and ecstasy, their tender love, passionate desire and wisdom, but also by their gayety, humor, and irony. As Faust proceeds with his devilish guide, it is his striving for understanding that becomes important, not the attainment, and in fact that is what saves him in the end. <em>Part I</em> of <em>Faust</em>, which Goethe published twenty-four years before its sequel, deals with Faust’s journey through the everyday world and his love for Gretchen. It is made memorable in this translation, which Professor Lange (of Princeton) has called “certainly the most usable and most appealing <em>Faust</em> translation in English. It is modern without losing the dignity of the original and is perhaps the only translation that conveys something of the freshness and poetic vitality of Goethe’s own speech.”</p>

<h2 id="slug-thirty-stories">_slug: thirty-stories</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Boyle is a story teller, a superb one; by and large the best in this country and one of the best now living,&rdquo; the Saturday Review wrote when Thirty Stories was first published. Selected from over one hundred stories written during twenty years, this volume includes many of her celebrated titles, masterpieces each in their separate ways, &ldquo;Wedding Day,&rdquo; &ldquo;Black Boy,&rdquo; &ldquo;The White Horses of Vienna,&rdquo; &ldquo;Count Lothar’s Heart,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Loneliest Man in the U.S. Army,&rdquo; for instance. Since Kay Boyle spent the years 1922 to 1941 in Europe, many of her characters and settings are European. But a deep love of nature, of mountains and water and forests make these settings universal, while the effect of nature––a flight of birds, for instance––on her characters suggests classic Japanese literature. The intensity with which she enters into these characters, their quandaries, their limitations, their resilience in the face of tragedy, makes memorable and honestly felt experience. As David Daiches has written, &ldquo;We can point to a story and say, ’There! Within these bounds is contained a true vision of some aspect of the human situation.’&rdquo; The San Francisco Chronicle said, in reviewing Thirty Stories, &ldquo;They have none of the earmarks of feminine fiction; they never strive for the neat ending; and the emotion always has a genuine ring, although often it is an emotion that you cannot name, that you can only feel&hellip; These stories show how Kay Boyle has developed her ’art of the short story.’ She has not been afraid of the untrodden path or of unfamiliar horizons.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="slug-poems-from-the-greek-anthology">_slug: poems-from-the-greek-anthology</h2>

<p>Probably no other single collection of poems captures the quality of a whole civilization as well as the Greek Anthology. Also called the Palatine Anthology, it consists of more than 4,000 short poems which were written as early as 700 BC and as late as the final subsidence of Greek culture 1,000 years after Christ. Here all Greeks go hand in hand––pagan and Christian, Athenian and Byzantine, republican and imperialist, laureate and private man. The range of mood and subject, as one might expect, is as wide as human experience itself. Dudley Fitts has translated a selection of these poems into modern, readable English verse. Poet as well as classicist, Fitts has caught the precise tone––comic or elegiac, dignified or plaintive––of each Greek original, and his poems stand as firmly in English as newly created works. This volume contains 141 examples from the Greek Anthology. They were chosen, first, because among all the originals they are the ones which are most manageable within the resources of modern poetry and, second, because they represent the extraordinary diversity of theme, character, and tone in the original collection. They comprise a book of pure enjoyment which no enterprising reader will want to miss.</p>

<p>Here, in the masterpiece completed just before his death in 1953, Dylan Thomas gave fullest expression to his sense of the magnificent flavor and variety of life. A moving and hilarious account of a spring day in a small Welsh coast town, <em>Under Milk Wood</em> begins with dreams and ghosts before dawn, moves through the brilliant, noisy day of the townspeople and closes as the &ldquo;rain of dusk brings on the bawdy night.&rdquo; As Randall Jarrell wrote: &ldquo;It would be hard for any work of art to communicate more directly and funnily and lovingly what it is like to be alive.&rdquo; Dylan Thomas called it &ldquo;a play for voices,&rdquo; and although it was commissioned by the British Broadcasting Corporation it had its first performances in New York, a series of try-outs in &ldquo;concert&rdquo; form, with Thomas directing and reading several parts. Enthusiastic audiences agreed with the critics, who called it &ldquo;probably the richest and certainly the earthiest theatre experience of the season&rdquo; (<em>Saturday Review</em>) and &ldquo;a dazzling combination of poetic fireworks and music-hall humor&rdquo; (<em>N. Y. Times</em>). When it was finally broadcast on the BBC Third Programme, <em>The New Statesman</em> and <em>Nation</em> wrote: &ldquo;It is lyrical, impassioned and funny, an <em>Our Town</em> given universality: by comparison with anything broadcast for a long time, it exploded on the air like a bomb––but a life-giving bomb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Throughout his life Flaubert made it a game to eavesdrop for the cliché, the platitude, the borrowed and unquestioned idea with which the “right thinking” swaddle their minds. After his death his little treasury of absurdities, of half-truths and social lies, was published as a <em>Dictionnaire des idées reçues</em>. Because its devastating humor and irony are often dependent on the phrasing in vernacular French, the <em>Dictionnaire</em> was long considered untranslatable. This notion was taken as a challenge by Jacques Barzun. Determined to find the exact English equivalent for each “accepted idea” Flaubert recorded, he has succeeded in documenting our own inanities. With a satirist’s wit and a scholar’s precision, Barzun has produced a very contemporary self-portrait of the middle-class philistine, a species as much alive today as when Flaubert railed against him.</p>

<p>Wolfgang Borchert died in 1947––the twenty-six-year-old victim of a malaria-like fever contracted during World War II. This was just one day after the premier of his play, <em>The Man Outside</em>, which caused an immediate furor throughout his native Germany with its youthful, indeed revolutionary, vision against war and the dehumanizing effects of the police state. In a very real sense, Borchert was both the moral and physical victim of the Third Reich and the Nazi war machine. As a Wehrmacht conscript, he twice served on the Russian front, where he was wounded, and twice was imprisoned for his outspokenness. His voice speaks plainly and powerfully from out of the war’s carnage all the more poignantly for its being cut short at so young an age. This collection of Borchert’s most important prose, translated by A. D. Porter with an Introduction by Stephen Spender, includes the complete text of the title play, as well as 39 stories and assorted pieces that comprise much of the author’s output during the two short, fever-ridden years in which he wrote, complemented by Kay Boyle’s appreciative Foreword.</p>

Its ingedients range from the small angel Astrolabe, to Toto the gorilla, from an impudently portrayed Julius Caeser to the newest wife of the founder of the Mormon church. There is the curious history of why mannequins do not speak. In a group of five stories—&rdquo;The Lost Papers of an Extra Man&rdquo;—one learns what goes on in a bachelor’s mind and heart, and at the dinner parties where he tends to lose both. In every piece within Love is a Pie there is the inimitable Hutchins style, her fresh and original way of looking at familiar matters, her piquant wit.</p>

<h2 id="slug-siddhartha1">_slug: siddhartha1</h2>

<p>Here the spirituality of the East and the West have met in a novel that enfigures deep human wisdom with a rich and colorful imagination.</p>

<p>Written in a prose of almost biblical simplicity and beauty, it is the story of a soul’s long quest in search of the ultimate answer to the enigma of man’s role on this earth. As a youth, the young Indian Siddhartha meets the Buddha but cannot be content with a disciple’s role: he must work out his own destiny and solve his own doubt—a tortuous road that carries him through the sensuality of a love affair with the beautiful courtesan Kamala, the temptation of success and riches, the heartache of struggle with his own son, to final renunciation and self-knowledge.</p>

<p>The name &ldquo;Siddhartha&rdquo; is one often given to the Buddha himself—perhaps a clue to Hesse’s aims in contrasting the traditional legendary figure with his own conception, as a European (Hesse was Swiss), of a spiritual explorer.</p>

<p>One of the most extraordinary events of the late nineteenth century in Paris was the opening on December 11, 1896, at the Théâtre de l’Oeuvre, of Alfred Jarry’s play <em>Ubu Roi</em>. The audience was scandalized by this revolutionary satire, developed from a schoolboy farce, which began with a four-letter word, defied all the traditions of the stage, and ridiculed the established values of bourgeois society. Barbara Wright’s witty translation of this riotous work is accompanied with drawings by Franciszka Themerson. Two previously untranslated essays in which Jarry explains his theories of the drama have also been included.</p>

<p><em>Blood Wedding</em>: Concerned with love that cannot become marriage among the primitive hill people of Castile, this is a play of the workings of tremendous passions and tribal ritual toward an inescapable tragic end.</p>

<p><em>Yerma</em>: According to Edwin Honig, author of a biography on Lorca, &ldquo;The whole tragic burden of <em>Yerma</em> is measured by the deepening of her struggle with the problem of frustrated motherhood.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The House of Bernarda Alba</em>: Again about “women whom love moves to tragedy,&rdquo; Bernarda Alba tells of the repression of five daughters by a domineering mother, of how their natural spirits circumvented her but bring violence and death.</p>

<h2 id="slug-starting-from-san-francisco">_slug: starting-from-san-francisco</h2>

<p><em>Starting From San Francisco</em>, first published in 1961, was the third collection of Lawrence Ferlinghetti’s poetry. The long poems of <em>Starting From San Francisco</em> present a new, quieter, more profound aspect of the poet. His original lyricism and caustic humor have been confronted, as it were, with the real presence of evil and death. &ldquo;Starting from Paumanok&hellip; I strike up for a New World&rdquo; wrote Walt Whitman in 1860. Starting from San Francisco, a hundred years later, Ferlinghetti roved back across the country (this &ldquo;cradle we rocked out of&rdquo;) then turned south of the border to visionary conclusions in that lost horizon symbolized by Machu Picchu, the Inca city the Spaniards never found. These poems of voyage are autobiographical in that they grew out of Ferlinghetti’s travels in South America and Europe, but there are also poems on other themes, including several long &ldquo;broadsides,&rdquo; which the author identifies as &ldquo;satirical tirades––poetry admittedly corrupted by the political, itself irradiated by the Thing it attacks.&rdquo; Commenting on this paperbook edition, to which two important poems, &ldquo;Berlin&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Situation in The West&rdquo; have been added, Ferlinghetti wrote: &ldquo;These poems represent to me a kind of halfway house in the ascent of a mountain I hardly knew existed until I stopped and looked back at the flatlands below. Like a Zen fool lost in the woods who laughs and lies face down on the earth to find his way.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Death on the Installment Plan</em> is a companion volume to Louis-Ferdinand Céline’s earlier novel, <em>Journey to the End of the Night</em>. Published in rapid succession in the middle 1930s, these two books shocked European literature and world consciousness. Nominally fiction but more rightly called &ldquo;creative confessions,&rdquo; they told of the author’s childhood in excoriating Paris slums, of service in the mud wastes of World War I and African jungles. Mixing unmitigated despair with Gargantuan comedy, they also created a new style, in which invective and obscenity were laced with phrases of unforgettable poetry. Céline’s influence revolutionized the contemporary approach to fiction. Under a cloud for a period, his work is now acknowledged as the forerunner of today’s &ldquo;black humor.&rdquo;</p>
