        <p>James Laughlin––poet, ladies’ man, heir to a steel fortune, and the founder of New Directions––was still at work on his autobiography when he died at 83. He left behind personal files crammed with memories and memorabilia: in &ldquo;M&rdquo; he is taking Marianne Moore to Yankee games (outings captured here in charming snapshots) to discuss &ldquo;arcane mammals,&rdquo; and in &ldquo;N&rdquo; nearly plunging off a mountain, hunting butterflies with Nabokov (&ldquo;Volya was a doll in a very severe upper-crust Russian way&rdquo;).</p>

<p>With an accent on humor, <em>The Way It Wasn’t</em> is a scrapbook loaded with ephemera––letters and memories, clippings and photographs. This richly illustrated album glitters like a magpie’s nest, if a magpie could have known Tennessee Williams, W.C. Williams, Merton, Miller, Stein, and Pound. In &ldquo;C&rdquo;: &ldquo;I wish that nice Jean Cocteau were still around. He took me to lunch at the Grand Véfours in the Palais-Royal and explained all about flying saucers. He understood mechanical things. He would advise me.&rdquo; In &ldquo;P&rdquo;: &ldquo;There was not much ’gracious living’ in Pittsburgh, where at one house, the butler passed chewing gum on a silver salver after coffee.&rdquo; And: &ldquo;The world is full of a large number of irritating people.&rdquo; In &ldquo;H&rdquo; there’s Lillian Hellman: &ldquo;What a raspy character. When I knocked at her door to try to borrow one of her books (hoping to butter her up) she only opened her door four inches and said words to the effect: ’Fuck off, you rapist.’&rdquo; Marketing in &ldquo;M&rdquo;: &ldquo;I think it’s important to get the ’troubadours’ into the title. That’s a ’buy-me’ word.&rdquo; In &ldquo;G&rdquo;: &ldquo;Olga asked Allen Ginsberg if he was also buying Pound Conference T-shirts for his grandchildren. She was most lovable throughout.&rdquo; In &ldquo;L&rdquo;: &ldquo;Wyndham Lewis wrote ’Why don’t you stop New Directions, your books are crap.’&rdquo; And we find love in &ldquo;L&rdquo;: &ldquo;Cicero noted that an old love pinches like a crab.&rdquo; But in <em>The Way It Wasn’t</em> James Laughlin’s love of the crazy world and his crazier authors does not pinch a bit: it glows with wit and enlarges our feeling for the late great twentieth century.</p>
