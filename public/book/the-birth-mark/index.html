<p>In this classic, groundbreaking exploration of early American literature, Susan Howe reads our intellectual inheritance as a series of civil wars, where each text is a wilderness in which a strange lawless author confronts interpreters and editors eager for settlement. Howe approaches Anne Hutchinson, Mary Rowlandson, Cotton Mather, Hawthorne, Emerson, Melville and Emily Dickinson as a fellow writer—her insights, fierce and original, are rooted in her seminal textural scholarship in examination of their editorial histories of landmark works. In the process, Howe uproots settled institutionalized roles of men and women as well as of poetry and prose—and of poetry and prose. <em>The Birth-mark</em>, first published in 1993, now joins the New Directions canon of a dozen Susan Howe titles. &mdash;

<h2 id="slug-lost-words">_slug: lost-words</h2>

<p>Inside an apartment building on the outskirts of Milan, the working-class residents gossip, quarrel, and conspire against each other. Viewed through the eyes of Chino, an impressionable thirteen-year-old boy whose mother is the building&rsquo;s doorwoman, the world contained within these walls is tiny, hypocritical, and mean-spirited: a constant struggle.</p>

<p>A new resident, Amelia Lynd, moves in and quickly becomes an unlikely companion to Chino. Ms. Lynd—an elderly, erudite British woman—nurtures his taste in literature, introduces him to the life of the mind, and offers a counterpoint to the only version of reality he&rsquo;s known. On one level, <em>Lost Words</em> is an engrossing coming-of-age tale set in the &lsquo;70s, when Italy was going through tumultuous social changes, and on another, it is a powerful meditation on language, literature, and culture.</p>
