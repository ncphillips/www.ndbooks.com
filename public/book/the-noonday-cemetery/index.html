        <p><em>The Noonday Cemetery &amp; Other Stories</em>, selected by Herling himself shortly before his death in 2000, are the 15 most representative and accomplished stories of the last two decades of his life. Contained herein are: &ldquo;The Noonday Cemetery,&rdquo; in which the widow of a WWII German officer and a cemetery custodian are both shot to death unexplainably; &ldquo;Beata Santa,&rdquo; about a Polish woman raped by Serbs and pressured to keep her child; &ldquo;A Hot Breath of the Desert,&rdquo; describing the lives of an archeologist couple, who settle down in the idyllic region of Lucania, until the wife (who’s witnessed WWII’s horrors), mysteriously loses her memory; and &ldquo;A Madrigal of Mourning,&rdquo; in which a woman musicologist falls in love with Carlo Gesualdo (1560-1613), Prince of Venosa, a madrigalist and murderer. Gustaw Herling’s memoir <em>A World Apart</em> is among the most powerful accounts of life in the Soviet gulag. And since Herling’s collection of interlinked novellas, <em>The Island</em>, was published to great acclaim in 1993, the number of American readers of this writer &ldquo;of extraordinary talent and scope&rdquo; (Louis Begley, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em>) has grown. <em>The Boston Globe</em> has said that Herling is &ldquo;a writer of stylistic mastery and moral depth, who deserves to be placed among the best in any language.&rdquo;</p>
