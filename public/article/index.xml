      <description>| THE INDIVIDUAL&amp;rsquo;S SOLILOQUY |
|
I&amp;rsquo;m the individual. First I lived by a rock (I scratched some figures on it) Then I looked for some place more suitable. I&amp;rsquo;m the individual. First I had to get myself food, Hunt for fish, birds, hunt up wood (I&amp;rsquo;d take care of the rest later) Make a fire, Wood, wood, where could I find any wood, Some wood to start a little fire, I&amp;rsquo;m the individual.</description>

      <title>Malambo Madness, Part II: In the Rockaways</title>

      <description>In my last post, I described New Directions&amp;rsquo; improbable trip to rural Argentina to witness the dance at the heart of Leila Guerriero’s US debut, A Simple Story. This month, malambo came to us. Or at least as close as the Rockaways, where dance troupe Che Malambo performed on Saturday at Kingsborough Community College.
Malambo can be tricky to explain. “It’s an Argentine folk dance,” you could say, “with a lot of intense tapping, kind of like Riverdance, but, uh, with gauchos?</description>

      <description>How often do you get the chance to step into one of your favorite books, look around, see the sights, chat with the characters? Then again, how often would you want to? The Communist wreckage of a collective farm in Satantango wouldn’t make the best vacation destination; nor would Aira’s Mérida of _The Literary Conference_—charming enough, but what about the monstrous blue silkworms?

I was able to, this past January, with Leila Guerriero’s A Simple Story.</description>

      <description>On a bright autumn day, some of us folks from New Directions took a trip to Sterling Pierce in Far Rockaway, the facility where our galleys and some other materials are printed. They showed us their magic printing machines, giant rolls of paper, and galley trimming guillotines. After our tour, the ever charming owner of Sterling Pierce, Bill Burke, took us on a ride on his boat aptly named Hot off the Press.</description>

      <description>Arthur Rimbaud, A SEASON IN HELL
Bob Dylan: “I came across one of [Rimbaud’s] letters called ‘Je est un autre,’ which translates into &amp;ldquo;I is someone else.&amp;rdquo; When I read those words the bells went off. It made perfect sense. I wished someone would have mentioned that to me earlier.” And, of course: “Situations have ended sad / Relationships have all been bad / Mine’ve been like Verlaine’s and Rimbaud / But there’s no way I can compare / All those scenes to this affair / Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go”</description>

      <description>Michael Palmer, _**The Laughter of the Sphinx **_At the beach the other week I saw a sculpture of a sphinx. Children were making eyes out of chalky shells as they pranced back and forth between the water-sand and dry-sand. The sphinx shaped into a squid and “the spirals of summer thought” caught me in a mesh of silent songs reflected in Palmer’s Euclidean light. Or whale light, our companions: the dolphin, the pelican, the cormorant, terns, and gulls, seabirds and the salt breeze crossing the Sound.</description>

      <description>Of the 1500 or so books that New Directions has published since 1936, around 1200 are in print. The ND library contains every single edition published. A dark, dusty room, the library holds first editions, Alvin Lustig covers singed by James Laughlin&amp;rsquo;s cigar, forgotten anthologies, stern handwritten warnings, and an unwrapped present without a card. (I peeked inside—it contains typewriter ribbon.)

      <description>We are deeply saddened by the loss of beloved writer and translator, Gregory Rabassa (1922-2016).
His translations of Gabriel García Márquez&amp;rsquo;s One Hundred Years of Solitude and Julio Cortázar&amp;rsquo;s Hopscotch have helped make these some of the most widely read works in world literature. (García Márquez was known to say that the English translation of One Hundred Years was better than the Spanish original.) Ilan Stavans writes, &amp;ldquo;We owe to Gregory Rabassa the rediscovery of Latin America—through its literature.</description>

      <description>New Directions was founded in 1936 by James Laughlin, following the advice of Ezra Pound to &amp;ldquo;do something useful.&amp;rdquo; Since then, New Directions has published over 1500 works of literature. We celebrated our 80th birthday last Friday at Greenlight Bookstore in Brooklyn.
For those who couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it, you missed: John Keene&amp;rsquo;s toast and a slice of his story &amp;ldquo;Rivers&amp;rdquo;; Rivka Galchen reading Ezra Pound and Stevie Smith; Eliot Weinberger&amp;rsquo;s tantric ode to the ND goddesses; Bernadette Mayer reading an erotic Chinese poem, a poem inspired by rap music, and another about Lyme disease; Anne Carson reading from The Albertine Workout, and anniversary poem to her husband, Currie; and László Krasznahoraki&amp;rsquo;s nihilistic reading, with an &amp;ldquo;except for New Directions&amp;rdquo; punch line.</description>

      <description>We mourn the loss of the great Japanese writer, Yuko Tsushima (1947-2016), whose writing was &amp;ldquo;as potent and heady as a dry martini&amp;rdquo; (The Village Voice), and return to her wonderful, unnerving story, &amp;ldquo;The Shooting Gallery&amp;rdquo;, translated by Geraldine Harcourt.
The two children suddenly leaned halfway out of the window of the moving train and shrieked in turn:
&amp;lsquo;Look! Over there!&amp;rsquo;
&amp;lsquo;It&amp;rsquo;s all shiny!&amp;rsquo;
&amp;lsquo;Is that the sea?&amp;rsquo;

      <description>Stevie Smith laughed at ghoulish things. Disarmingly playful, her poetry is equal parts grief and glee.
All the Poems gathers Smith&amp;rsquo;s line drawings together with her poems, as she always wished them to be published. The following are a selection from her collected works, edited by Smith scholar Will May.
Enjoy!

      <description>**White Linen  **  A little movement stirs the linen,  it&#39;s in the garden, in the wind  which comes, a marvel, from the sky.  The sky is halfway still, half wild;  half it is involved with cloud,  half stepping brightly out in blue.  Already the sun has been forgotten  and all the world is making ready  to disappear into a garden  which is evening; white the linen  stirs in a gentle wind, the evening  wind, does it make a sort of linen  airily also stir in me?</description>

      <description>All the pictures below are drawn from Looking At Pictures, a collection of Robert Walser&amp;rsquo;s joyful musings on art, which make most art criticism sound like highfalutin twaddle. A delicious line from each essay has been plucked to serve as a peephole into the piece.
Turn your eye on Cézanne, Fragonard, and Van Gogh and see what Walser saw. Never have essays on classical art been such a pleasure and delight to read, thanks in no small part to translators Susan Bernofsky, Lydia Davis, and Christopher Middleton.</description>

A Hora de Clarice has been running in Brazil for the last five years with simultaneous celebrations in Paris, Madrid, Lisbon, Frankfurt, Buenos Aires, and Mexico City. Bringing the tradition to New York, we celebrated Clarice&amp;rsquo;s birthday with champagne at 192 Books.

      <description>While watching a documentary on the German composer Hans Werner Henze, directed by Michael Blackwood, our publisher, Barbara Epler, spotted a familiar face: none other than Muriel Spark, sitting among Alberto Moravio and Ingeborg Bachmann at a dinner party, telling a funny story. It is nothing short of a great victory to see Spark here as she was: sharp, witty, mischievous, wicked—gleefully holding court amongst fellow writers and artists.
Please enjoy this short clip retrieved from the documentary.</description>

      <description>This Minute
this minute, a man carries a coffin down the street his buttons are open, he&amp;rsquo;s sweaty all over his feet tap the street splashed with starlight he sees the death-dark roofs and red-skinned lamps from his dreams we live together on this planet of deserts and seas
this minute, the wind advances on the roadless ocean and desert who moves all the trash? who turns a flashlight to the sky?</description>

      <description>After Someone&amp;rsquo;s Death
Once there was a shock that left behind a long pale glimmering comet&amp;rsquo;s tail. It contains us. It blurs TV images. It deposits itself as cold drops on the aerials.
You can still shuffle along on skis in the winter sun among groves where last year&amp;rsquo;s leaves still hang. They are like pages torn from old telephone directories— the names are eaten up by the cold.
It is still beautiful to feel your heart throbbing.</description>

Aira&amp;rsquo;s short story &amp;ldquo;Picasso&amp;rdquo; begins thus:
 It all began when the genie came out of the Magic Milk bottle and asked me what I would prefer: to have a Picasso or to be Picasso. He could grant me either wish but, he warned me, only one of the two.</description>

The great poet Rosmarie Waldrop says of Unrue&amp;rsquo;s first book with New Directions, &amp;ldquo;Rather than leading us out of the maze, the narrative thread has itself become a labyrinthine tangle.</description>

      <description>As a teenager in the early 1960s, I wrote a short story called “But Not for Me,&amp;rdquo; inspired by and written while listening to Ahmad Jamal&amp;rsquo;s album Live at the Pershing: But Not for Me. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a very good story but it launched a pattern in which music would repeatedly impact, appear in and be referred to in my writing, whether poetry or prose. The examples are so numerous and so obvious as to all but go without needing mention, beginning with my first chapbook, dedicated to John Coltrane, taking its title from Archie Shepp&amp;rsquo;s album Four for Trane and extending to particular musicians and pieces of music being said to be “on the box&amp;rdquo; in my ongoing serial poems Song of the Andoumboulou and “Mu,&amp;rdquo; each of which takes its title from a piece of recorded music.</description>

Howe confirmed its authenticity with this note: &amp;ldquo;I did teach it! That is my course. I always went over the top in my syllabi because I was so insecure about being in academia!&amp;rdquo; Adding: &amp;ldquo;Good god. Will wonders never cease.</description>

A woman sits at a desk writing an account of her life. The desk is in Moscow. This is the third time in her life she&amp;rsquo;s been asked to write an account of it, and it&amp;rsquo;s entirely possible that this written account will put an end to her life, possible that this piece of writing will be transformed, if you will, into a weapon to be used against her.</description>

      <description>One hundred years ago today, on October 30, 1914, James Laughlin—poet, heir to a steel fortune, and the founder of New Directions—was born. The story of New Directions begins when young Laughlin asked Ezra Pound for career advice. Pound told him to give up on poetry and &amp;ldquo;do something useful&amp;rdquo; instead. Laughlin founded New Directions in 1936.
Quietly, he continued to write. Charles Simic writes of Laughlin&amp;rsquo;s poetry: &amp;ldquo;The secret is out, the publisher of Williams and Pound is himself a great lyric poet.</description>

      <description>The wonderful German writer Siegfried Lenz died yesterday in Hamburg. He was 88.
Breon Mitchell, in his introduction to Lenz&amp;rsquo;s Selected Stories, remembers the writer&amp;rsquo;s acceptance speech for the 1989 Heinz Galinski Foundation Prize: &amp;ldquo;Lenz spoke again of memory and imagination as a &amp;lsquo;defense against the indifference of history,&amp;rsquo; and announced that he would donate the substantial award he received to a home for the aged in Jerusalem. Then he prepared to depart, as he does each summer, for a small fisherman&amp;rsquo;s cottage on the Danish island of Alsen, where for several years now he has painstakingly produced his stories at a rate of three pages a day.</description>

      <description>In Brooklyn this past Tuesday, the alternative film venue Light Industry hosted a screening of _The Driver&amp;rsquo;s Seat_—Giuseppe Patroni Griffi&amp;rsquo;s 1974 Italian film adaptation of Muriel Spark&amp;rsquo;s 1970 novella. Originally released as Indentikit, the film stars Elizabeth Taylor and features Andy Warhol among its cast members.
En route to Rome, the erratic Lise, played by Taylor, travels to meet her illusory boyfriend. The film was introduced by Eric Banks, director of NYU&amp;rsquo;s New York Institute for the Humanities and a former senior editor of Artforum who relaunched Booksforum in 2003.</description>

      <description>In Stealth, a novel by the Egyptian writer Sonallah Ibrahim, a young boy wanders the serpentine streets of Cairo, imbimbing its sights and sounds, and peeping into the world of the elite. To celebrate its US publication, we asked motion collage artist and poet Nathaniel Whitcomb to put together a mini-animated trailer. Inspired by vintage View Masters, Whitcomb flips through photos taken by Don Church of 1950s Cairo to let the viewer &amp;rdquo;peek in with care&amp;rdquo; to Ibrahim’s childhood world.</description>

      <description>How fitting that an evening celebrating Muriel Spark saw a downpour so relentless that umbrellas were useless. Last night, brave Spark lovers came together to remember the writer whose cleverness and wit produced classics that include The Ballad of Peckham Rye, The Driver’s Seat, and Memento Mori. Leading the charge was moderator Michael Barron and panelists Barbara Epler, Emily Stokes, Maud Newton, Sadie Stein, and Thessaly LaForce.
The Informed Air, the first collection of Spark’s essays, edited by her friend the artist Penelope Jardine, is now available in hardcover from New Directions.</description>

      <description>Roberto Bolaño’s reputation has become that of a writer’s writer, but he might also be called a writer’s reader—for his wide, absorbent, Borgesian literary erudition—or maybe even a reader’s writer, whatever that might be. Bolaño’s love of reading informed much of his own writing, and in a short autobiographical piece, he claimed to be “much happier reading than writing.” In this sense, probably the best way to continue reading Bolaño is to read like Bolaño.</description>

      <description>The French author Margueritte Yourcenar, in an unlikely biography of Yukio Mishima, wrote that the Japanese writer had long “envisioned a certain kind of death and made it,” and that his suicide was “his masterpiece.” Among the many writer suicides—sadly there’s no shortage—Mishima’s is still one of the most remarkable: he spent years plotting, articulating, and rehearsing his death until finally, on November 25, 1970, moments after failing to incite a military coup, he plunged a ceremonial tanto knife in his stomach.</description>

      <description>“Choose an author as you would choose a friend,” Wentworth Dillon, Earl of Roscommon, counseled aspiring translators some four centuries ago. But affinity, literary and otherwise, can be unpredictable. Under the fluorescent lights of the New York University basement classroom where I first read the poems of the Argentine poet Oliverio Girondo (1890-1967), I could never have imagined the challenging, whimsical companion he would become.
Girondo made a reputation for himself on both sides of the Atlantic with his debut collection, Veinte poemas para ser leídos en el tranvía [Twenty Poems to Read on a Streetcar], which in turn inspired the title of the recently published New Directions pamphlet.</description>

      <description>Ernesto Cardenal, Latin America’s legendary poet-activist, will celebrate his 89th birthday on January 20. He’s had quite a life—revolutionary, Catholic priest, liberation theologian, founder of a commune and eventual artists’ colony, sculptor, teacher, political leader, and internationally renowned poet.
Born in Granada, on the northern shore of Lake Nicaragua, Cardenal wrote his first poem when he was 6 years old. He started publishing love poems in his early twenties while growing political.</description>

But before I share my little discovery, I want to emphasize that what I learned relates not only to these fifteen poems but to the many other poems I read in making this slim selection.</description>

Naked between exhalation and—
Naked with hidden fans blowing, a few feathers undulating on the heap.

You see them live, Eiko &amp;amp; Koma, and time slows down and opens up at once. The time that has directed you all your life so that you wake just before your alarm goes off and you know the feel of how long it takes to get from home to office, that given, your internal clock, it isn’t given.</description>

Using various exposure techniques, Frame exposes dark, shadowy glmpses of people that initially arouse feelings of suspicion only to transcend, upon closer view, into something both intimate and sinister. Frame, who has been an active photographer since the 1970s, will have a new show of work, &amp;ldquo;Dialogue With Bolaño,&amp;ldquo; opening at the Gitterman Gallery on November 6.</description>

      <description>This month, New Directions publishes the second book and first collection of stories by the Cuban writer Guillermo Rosales.

The Cuban journalist and novelist, Norberto Fuentes, provided this edition with the following introduction.
* * *
The author of the two books that make up _Leapfrog &amp;amp; Other Stories _did everything he could so that none of this would make it into the reader’s hands.</description>

      <description>Just a few more days until Keith Ridgway’s novel Hawthorn &amp;amp; Child hits bookstores, so we’d thought we’d share another excerpt. This one is a bit longer, and comes from a chapter entitled &amp;ldquo;How to Have Fun with a Fat Man,&amp;rdquo; which is about a third of the way into the book. That’s all the context you’ll need.
Ridgway will also be making a pair of appearances in New York (sorry, we like him so much we’re keeping him to ourselves) in the next week.</description>

      <description>After almost a year of anticipation, we’re finally mere days away from the official publication date of Keith Ridgway’s Hawthorn &amp;amp; Child, a novel so mind-bendingly brilliant that it very nearly defies description. But one must try, right? How about this, borrowed from Granta Books, who published it in the UK:
 Hawthorn and Child are mid-ranking detectives tasked with finding significance in the scattered facts. They appear and disappear in the fragments of this book along with a ghost car, a crime boss, a pick-pocket, a dead racing driver and a pack of wolves.</description>

      <description>Finally available in English, thanks to a wonderful translation by Katherine Silver, Professor Borges is a transcribed series of lectures that the Argentine author gave at the University of Buenos Aires in 1966. The subject? The history of English Literature. That alone should be enough to intrigue you, but it’s also worth noting a few details. For starters, Borges was already blind when he gave the twenty-five lectures, and so everything he said, including all of the passages he quotes, was done from memory.</description>

      <description>Legris anatomizes song—birdsong, but also the aspiring song of the poet. Is this an impossible task? Bones, soft tissue, and even spit can be pinpointed, but what about breath? motile air? pneuma or spirit? What about this:
Jizz of airborne lungs: venturi tube trachea; cul-de-sac lift / drag ratio; emphysematic airflow. – from “Lore: 7 (aspect ratio)&amp;rdquo;

JR: On the internet, your biography is nicely spare. But I would love to know a little more, particularly since your poetry doesn’t inhabit a landscape, not one with fixed markers.</description>

      <description>_Gawker_’s Nitasha Tiku recently wrote a piece about Pablo Neruda’s body being exhumed to (hopefully, finally) determine if he died of prostate cancer — as was reported at the time of his death, a mere twelve days after the CIA-backed coup that put Pinochet in power — or if, as many people have claimed over the years, he was murdered. The investigation into Neruda’s death is part of a much larger one into hundreds of human rights atrocities carried out by Pinochet and his followers over the years.</description>

Not to jump onto the bandwagon of hype that is surrounding The Great Gatsby movie, but here’s a bit of Gatsby trivia: New Directions published an edition of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s magnum opus in 1945.
From what I understand, Scribner’s had let the book lapse out-of-print, allowing New Directions to lease the rights. James Laughlin—a longtime Fitzgerald fan (before it was hip to be one)—acquired The Great Gatsby for its New Classics series—the jacket art (above) was designed by Alvin Lustig.</description>

      <description>Though my memory is foggy, especially many years out of college, I’m fairly certain that the first ND book I read was Ezra Pound’s Guide to Kulchur. It’s an odd book, to say the least, and memorable for its pithy &amp;ldquo;advice&amp;rdquo; as much as for its patent brilliance. I also remember, however, reading Charles Baudelaire’s Paris Spleen not long after. And seeing as today marks the 192nd anniversary of Baudelaire’s birth, and despite the unbelievably nice weather in New York and the subsequent pleasant mood it tends to inspire in everyone, I thought I’d share one of my favorites from the collection, &amp;ldquo;The Motley Fool and Venus.</description>

      <description>Happy Poetry Month! We’re a day late starting the festivities, but to make up for the delay we’ve got an excerpt from Susan Howe’s Sorting Facts, or 19 Ways of Looking at Marker, part of the (new) New Directions Poetry Pamphlets series, the first four of which we published in March. The book is essentially what the title suggests: the poet’s powerful mediation on the filmmaker’s work.

Whether your community is hosting readings, or a parade, or erecting a statue of the local poet laureate in your town square, today is the day to unabashedly celebrate the verse. Never written a poem? Perhaps today is the day you finally put pen to paper. And if you need encouragement, look no further than Chilean poet Nicanor Parra’s &amp;ldquo;Young Poets&amp;rdquo; from _Poems and Antipoems_ for sagely advise on composing poetry.</description>

      <description>Fans of our books know that we’re very proud of our association with the great modernist designer Alvin Lustig, who created over seventy covers for New Directions between 1941-1952. Several prints of his iconic designs decorate our office walls, and lately we’ve been rejacketing backlist titles with their original Lustig covers.
In May you’ll be able to buy reprints of fifty of his designs for New Directions in postcard form. If you can bear to part with them — you might just want to plaster your wall with them — you can go ahead and throw away your existing stationary and instead use Lustig covers for all of your written correspondence.</description>

      <description>Today is the official publication day of our new, expanded, anniversary edition of Raymond Queneau’s groundbreaking experimental &amp;ldquo;novel&amp;rdquo; Exercises in Style. This new edition has a few special features. First, the beautiful new (old) cover. Second, pieces written by Queneau that, for whatever reason, were left out of the original edition but have now been translated (by Chris Clarke) and added at the end. And third, homage pieces written by some contemporary writers, all of them proven stylists in their own right.</description>

      <description>It’s not often that we announce future publications prior to publicly sharing a forthcoming season’s list, but this is a special case, prompted by a gathering curiosity among American readers that has resulted in queries in the form of emails, tweets, and questions over cocktails at totally unrelated events. So, for everyone who has asked, yes, we will be publishing Irish author Keith Ridgway’s Hawthorn &amp;amp; Child, which was published by Granta books back in July of 2012.</description>

+++
DLB: What’s your sense of how Queneau thought of Exercises in Style as belonging to or being independent from the Oulipo?
CC: Hard to say. I’m not really the one to ask that—most everything I know about the exercises comes from the appendices of the Pléiade Oeuvres complètes, which is a wonderful collection, as well as from a few critical works that I looked through when I was writing on the substitutions in the Wright translation.</description>

      <description>Simply because it exists, we ordered up a copy of an out-of-print book called Atlas, published in 1985 and gathering images of Jorge Luis Borges in various locations around the world, along with his thoughts on these places. The production quality, to be frank, is rather poor, but it’s still a joy to look at pictures of Borges getting in a hot air balloon in California, sitting in front of gigantic statues in Geneva (where he’s buried), staring up at a minaret in Istanbul, or sitting on a bench in the Labyrinth in Crete.</description>

While visiting a friend in the Twin Cities a few years back, I made it a point to visit the store (and the Ashbery Bridge, which is very cool… the big cherry not so much) and loved it from the moment I stepped inside. Micawber’s is, to mind at least, the quintessential independent bookstore: the tables are stocked with personally chosen titles; the staff recommendations are made with great care and attention; and the owners are there, right behind the counter, as much as they can be.</description>

Since he’s largely unknown in the English-speaking/reading world, we thought we’d offer an informal introduction. To begin with, however, we should offer the caveat that there really isn’t a great deal to be offered simply because, as translator Katherine Silver points out in her preface to the book, &amp;ldquo;biographical information is sparse and anecdotal.</description>

Queneau took a simple plot — a moment of confusion on a bus — and retold it in ninety-nine different ways, each version a stylistic wonder, from &amp;ldquo;Sonnets&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Onomatopoeia&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Animism.&amp;rdquo; The result is a masterpiece of experimental fiction, which was then gorgeously translated by Barbara Wright.</description>

Sally Bowles is often the focal point, and it’s hard to argue with that decision, especially when she’s rendered as well as she is in the Vintage, Signet, and Penguin Modern Classics editions. The simple hardcover edition (second row, far left) is beautiful, but stark in comparison.</description>

Below is an excerpt that we’re posting in Marker’s memory.

      <description>Summer reading lists have been appearing everywhere in recent weeks, all operating on the assumption that we as a nation will be sitting on a beach somewhere attempting to shrug off the troubles of the world by enjoying some &amp;ldquo;light&amp;rdquo; reading. This, of course, is nonsense. While this may be true for some people, most people’s reading habits don’t change because the weather does. If this were true, people in Florida would never read the Russian masters and Alaskans would never read anything but the Russian masters.</description>

      <description>At the urging of New Directions President Barbara Epler, we decided to give our cover for Vladimir Nabokov’s (amazing) novel The Real Life of Sebastian Knight a fresh coat of paint. Here’s the original design — by Rodrigo Corral — for our 2008 edition, which includes an introduction by critic Michael Dirda.
It’s beautiful. The dark silhoutte behind the thick, textured glass is absolutely perfect for the plot, and the composition lends the book the the classical status it has earned.</description>

      <description>For all of the false-positive, nonsensical results that Google Alerts produce, there are always the fascinating discoveries that we’re pointed to with great appreciation. Take, for example, this post by Nicholas Mirzoeff, an NYU professor, author, and the creator of a blog where he posts daily observations about Occupy movements around the world.
Writing about the situation in Greece back in January, he evoked Sophokles’ Antigone, along with its reinterpretations and allusions to it, most recently in Alexis: A Greek Tragedy.</description>

      <description>If there’s one novel that lends itself to cinematic exploration, it’s W. G. Sebald’s beloved masterpiece The Rings of Saturn. It’s impossible not to crave to see what the narrator sees on his walking tour of the Eastern English Coast, and though the curious archive of photographs offers glimpses of the scenery, fans have always wanted more. Lo and behold, as you can see in the video below, director Grant Gee has created a wonderful ode to the novel in the form of a feature documentary entitled Patience (After Sebald).</description>

      <description>I first came across Tony Fitzpatrick’s wonderful collage art when this post came up in google alert for Roberto Bolaño. Explaining his &amp;ldquo;Bird for the Daughters of Juarez&amp;rdquo; (below), he writes:
 The underlying thematic device, for me, seems to be the world’s rapid untethering from any idea of sanity. The murdered women part of ’2666’ is where we hear Bolaño at his most ferocious. The murder of innocents is still a thing of incomprehensible sadness; well-worthy of moral outrage even in an insane world.</description>

      <description>Like all publishers, I believe, we have a library containing copies of every book we’ve ever published. And since it contains first editions of Lustig-designed titles by Ezra Pound, Tennessee Williams, Nabokov, and on an on, we like to show it off to visitors. All of that handling, however, means that the books get out of alphabetical order. It’s like a bookstore in that way, I suppose (I do _not _miss shelving books).</description>

      <description>Truth is we’ve been dying to find a reason to talk about the newly relaunched version of The Chicagoan, a beautifully produced and brilliantly edited magazine that published its first issue back in early March. It’s gotten attention from far and wide, including The Chicago Tribune, Time Out Chicago, The Economist, and The Millions. Having finally gotten my hands on a copy, I have to say that the praise is much deserved.</description>

      <description>On March 29, Jochen Greven, widely considered the world’s leading Robert Walser scholar, passed away. Susan Bernofsky, who has translated several of Walser’s books into English, has posted a touching, personal note of rememberence for Greven on her blog, Translationista. Posted below is the first paragraph, but you can read the full piece here.
&amp;ldquo;I have been indebted to Jochen Greven my entire professional life. His name first entered my consciousness when I was seventeen: I had requested as a birthday gift Das Gesamtwerk by Robert Walser, which turned out to be a softcover boxed set published by Suhrkamp Verlag, each of its twelve volumes beautifully wrapped in linen, in a shade of forest-green I have associated with Walser and German literature ever since.</description>

      <description>A few weeks back, I had the pleasure of talking to hundreds of booksellers — in groups of about eight at a time — about Anne Carson’s forthcoming book, Antigonick. Of course I mentioned her previous book, Nox, and of course I ended up saying &amp;ldquo;beautiful book-in-a-box&amp;rdquo; dozens of times over the course of three days. Which led me to wonder (since I wasn’t here at New Directions when Nox was first published, and didn’t read every review of it) how the various reviewers chose to describe the physical nature of the &amp;ldquo;book.</description>

If you ever turned over a New Directions book — after admiring the cover — to look for the design credit, then you know who Rodrigo Corral is. As our creative director at-large, he’s been responsible for over two dozen beautiful covers over the past five years, including the new edition of Berlin Stories, last year’s Between Parentheses, and the entire Pearl series, just to name a few.</description>

      <description>It’s official: Anne Carson’s new book, a new translation of Sophokles’ Antigone called Antigonick (the title makes sense in the context of the new translation, I swear) is off at the printer, and should be landing on our fair shores sometime in late April. Similar to Nox, this is a lovingly crafted and produced book. This time around, Carson has hand-lettered the text on the pages (see below), and artist Bianca Stone (a former student of Carson’s) has provided color illustrations (also below), which are being printed on translucent vellum pages.</description>

      <description>Last week, editor Barbara Epler and I were in New Orleans, where we were meeting (and wining and dining) booksellers at the American Booksellers Association’s Winter Institute — sort of like Book Expo America minus all the glitz and carnival barking. While we were there, we took some time to find Faulkner House Books, a store in the heart of the French Quarter (with a very cool Pirate’s Alley address) where owner Joe DeSalvo, along with his wife Rosemary, specializes in all things literarily New Orleans.</description>

      <description>Reviewer Ben Bevacqua revels in Krasznahorkai’s masterpiece, saying that &amp;ldquo;Krasznahorkai’s mastery of structure, character, and language is matched by his ability to simultaneously weave all three together; readers can feel themselves physiologically immersed in the world of the book, itself a finely orchestrated system.&amp;rdquo; Read the full review here. </description>

Lawrence Ferlinghetti: poet, novelist, publisher, bookseller, social activist, and much more. An enduring American icon at a time when achieving such status seems impossible. The December 19 issue of _The Nation_ features a new poem by Ferlinghetti, one that addresses Occupy Wall Street and its attendant issues.</description>

With this installment of Awesome Author Photos, we present Clarice Lispector. New Directions recently published a new edition of her most famous novel, The Hour of the Star, in a new translation by biographer Benjamin Moser, who is also overseeing the publication of four new editions of Lispector’s work in May of next year (more on that below).</description>

      <description>In advance of this Sunday’s 40th anniversary marathon reading of Frederic Tuten’s avant-garde novel The Adventures of Mao on the Long March (more information about the event can be found here), we thought it might make sense to say a few words about the unique novel. First, it’s by no means a novel in the traditional sense. The over-arching plot is what the title suggests: a history of the Long March, with Chairman Mao as the central character.</description>

Frontman for the seminal punk band Television (first known as The Neon Boys) and later for The Voidoids. He became a legend in the punk scene. Malcolm McLaren says that Hell inspired the look for the Sex Pistols. D. Boon cites him as an influence in &amp;ldquo;History Lesson Part II&amp;rdquo;. And he has undoubtedly inspired legions of lesser-known punk and hardcore bands. And hopefully still is.</description>

      <description>We can keep quiet on this odd bit of theater news no longer. Multi-talented actor James Franco will make a one-time appearance in a commissioned play entitled Three Artists in Search of Tennessee Williams. Being staged this Sunday, November 13 at noon, the play is part of the Performa 11 biennial festival that’s currently underway in New York. Act II features a video of Franco playing the Gentlemen Caller from The Glass Menagerie, while a series of actresses audition for the role of Laura via karaoke.</description>

      <description>As you might have heard, New Directions has been publishing books since 1936, seventy-five years. And for the last forty or so years, we’ve been in the same 19th floor space on 14th Street in Chelsea, which means that a lot our history is still here, happily reminding us of the past. Our library contains (nearly) every first edition of every book we’ve ever published, many of them well-handled and worse for the wear, but still bearing the iconic covers designed by Alvin Lustig.</description>

Thanks again for coming, and we hope you snagged a door prize. Since we wanted to allow the readers to reveal their favorites as they took the stage, we didn’t include that information in the program.</description>

Weinberger and Davis, having known eachother since highschool, exchanged humorous comments about who was the &amp;ldquo;cooler kid&amp;rdquo; back in the day before settling ito read. Coincidentally, both authors had a similar trajectory to their readings: three or four short new pieces followed by a much longer &amp;ldquo;poem essay.</description>

      <description>As discussed in her interview with _Bookforum_’s Morten Høi Jensen, Helen DeWitt cites Mel Brooks’s 1968 film The Producers as inspiration for her second novel Lightning Rods. She says:
 It had been 18 months since my first agent told me she could get an advance so I could finish writing Samurai; instead I had had well over a year of unsolicited advice. I couldn’t look at the book, thought I would never write again.</description>

      <description>To say that it’s been a bit crazy around here since Swedish poet Tomas Tranströmer won the 2011 Nobel Prize in Literature last Thursday is a vast understatement. We were giddy, of course. Beside ourselves. There’s nothing quite like the Nobel Prize to remind you — to reassure you — that what you do on daily basis on behalf of all of these brilliant writers and poets matters tremendously, and in turn that a great many people find enormous value in literature.</description>

      <description>In terms of cultural popularity, the most enduring songs on _Combat Rock — _The Clash’s fifth studio album — are, in no particular order, “Rock the Casbah”, “Should I Stay or Should I Go”, and “Know Your Rights”. The best song on the album, however, is probably “Straight to Hell,” a haunting and generally underappreciated song that should be recognizable to fans of M.I.A, who sampled the opening guitar and drum riff in her popular hit “Paper Planes”.</description>

      <description>_Kushner&amp;rsquo;s “commanding translation captures the unlikely combination of insouciance and resignation that defines Rosales’s tone.” (Words Without Borders). Anna tells the story of discovering the book in Spanish, and the following journey of securing the rights to the book in order to translate it. Her insight into Rosales and his work provides an original perspective on the novel that truly enhances the meaning and significance of the work. _
