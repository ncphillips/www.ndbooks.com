In the annals of modern American letters, William Everson holds prime place as a poet of conscience and consciousness of self, his richly textured verse mapping his extraordinary inner journey as social activist, Dominican brother, and preeminent religious and philosophical poet. In _William Everson: The Life of Brother Antoninus_, Lee Bartlett charts the outer journey, drawing on the reminiscences of the poetry, his friends, and a wealth of archival material.
