One of the greatest poets of the twentieth century, Dylan Thomas prepared this collection of ninety poems shortly before his early death in 1953\. These are the poems he felt best represented his work, and this collection honors the 50th anniversary of the poet’s death. In addition to the textual corrections in this revised edition (originally published as _The Collected Poems of Dylan Thomas_ in 1953 by New Directions), a short chronology of the poet’s life and an index of titles’ and first lines have been added as well as the unfinished poem "In Country Heaven."
