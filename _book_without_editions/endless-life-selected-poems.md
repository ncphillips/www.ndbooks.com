Lawrence Ferlinghetti is surely (as a reviewer in _Booklist_ phrased it) "one of our ageless radicals and true bards." He has consistently spoken in poetic terms accessible to every type of reader about our life and time and its issues, not only the political ones but those of the interior life. Behind the immediacy of what _Library Journal_ called his "Dynamic, verbose, alarming, charming, and unsettling" poetry and its irresistible spontaneity lie serious thought and erudition. His motivation has been to be (in his words) "an agent provocateur––subversive, anarchistic, and prophetic." _Endless Life: Selected Poems_ is the poet’s own choice, the poems that still excite him, from eight previous books of poetry. These start with _Pictures of the Gone World_ (1955), the first book he published under his own City Lights imprint, followed by _A Coney Island of the Mind_ (1958), a literary landmark with almost a million copies in print the world over and the first of Ferlinghetti’s thirteen books brought out by New Directions. Starting from _San Francisco_ (1961), _The Secret Meaning of Things_ (1969), _Open Eye, Open Heart_ (1973), _Who Are We Now?_ (1976), _Northwest Ecolog_ (City Lights, 1978), and _Landscapes of Living & Dying_ (1979) are each generously represented. The final section of the book includes the long title poem, "Endless Life."
