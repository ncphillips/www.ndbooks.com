_Fresco: Selected Poetry of Luljeta Lleshanaku_ introduces to English-speaking readers the arresting work of Luljeta Lleshanaku, one of Albania’s foremost younger poets. Born in Elbasan in 1968, she grew up under virtual house arrest because of her family’s opposition to the Stalinist dictatorship of Enver Hoxha. She is foremost among the first generation of poets to emerge out of the cultural wasteland of enforced socialist realism in the arts, reinventing Albanian poetry almost entirely from scratch. In a voice at once firm yet quiet and spare, with haunting imagery that challenges the imagination, her highly charged poems carry the burden of her own and her country’s past. For _Fresco_, editor Henry Israeli has gathered fifty-eight poems from Luljeta Lleshanaku’s published books (_The Sleepwalker’s Eyes_, 1992; _Sunday Bells_, 1994; _Half-Cubism_, 1996; _Antipastoral_, 1999) as well as some newer work. His Afterword places her writing within its personal and social context, while an Introduction by the award-winning translator Peter Constantine views the poet from the wider perspective of modern Albanian literature.
