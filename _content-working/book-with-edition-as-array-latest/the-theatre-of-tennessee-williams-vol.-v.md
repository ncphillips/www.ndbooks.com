_The Theatre of Tennessee Williams_ brings together in a matching format the plays of a genius of the American theatre. Arranged in chronological order, this ongoing series includes the original cast listings and production notes. Leading off _Volume 5_ is _The Milk Train Doesn’t Stop Here Anymore_ (1964), a play that explores the tenacity of the human body and spirit when confronted with death. The more light-hearted _Kingdom of Earth_ (_The Seven Descents of Myrtle_) was first produced on Broadway in 1968: the text offered here incorporates changes the author made for its 1975 revival. _Small Craft Warnings_ (1972), one of Williams’s more searching works, is based on one of his shorter dramas, "Confessional," published in _Dragon Country_ (1969). The volume concludes with _The Two-Character Play_ (1975), the author’s reworking of his earlier _Out Cry_ (1973).
