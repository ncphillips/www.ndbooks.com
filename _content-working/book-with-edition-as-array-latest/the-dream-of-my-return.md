Is the journalist’s plan to return a dream or a nightmare? Is he courageous, foolhardy, or just plain dumb? Is the bubbling brew of horrors and threats actual or imagined? After seeking relief for the pain in his liver through hypnosis, his few remaining impulse-control mechanisms rapidly dissolve, and reality only rarely intrudes on his cogitations. Hair-brained murder plots, half-mad arguments, and hysterical rants: the narrative escalates at a maniacal pace, infused with Horacio Castellanos Moya’s uniquely outlandish and unlikely acerbic sense of humor.
