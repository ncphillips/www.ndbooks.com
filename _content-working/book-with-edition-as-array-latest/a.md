At long last, here is the whole of Louis Zukofsky’s epic masterpiece _"A"_ back in print with misprints corrected and a new, fresh introduction by the noted scholar Barry Ahearn. No other poem in the English language is filled with as much daily love, light, intellect, and music. As William Carlos Williams once wrote of Zukofsky’s poetry, "I hear a new music of verse stretching out into the future."
