Mrs. Hawkins, the majestic narrator of _A Far Cry from Kensington_, takes us well in hand and leads us back to her threadbare years in postwar London. There, as a fat but much admired young war widow, she spent her days working for a mad, near-bankrupt publisher ("of very good books") and her evenings dispensing advice at her small South Kensington rooming house. At work and at home, Mrs. Hawkins soon uncovered evil; shady literary doings and a deadly enemy; anonymous letters, blackmail, and suicide. With aplomb, however, Mrs. Hawkins confidently set about putting things to order, little imagining the mayhem which would ensue. Now decades older, thin, successful, and delighted with life in Italy – a far cry from Kensington – Mrs. Hawkins looks back to those dark doings, and recounts how her own life changed forever. She still, however, loves to give advice: "It’s easy to get thin. You eat and drink the same as always, only half .... I offer this advice without fee; it is included in the price of this book." A masterwork by "Britain’s greatest living novelist" (_The Sunday Telegraph_), _A Far Cry from Kensington_ has been hailed as "outstanding" (_The Observer_) and "wickedly and adroitly executed" (_The New York Times_). "_Far Cry_ is, among other things, a comedy that holds a tragedy as an egg-cup holds an egg" (_The Philadelphia Inquirer_).
