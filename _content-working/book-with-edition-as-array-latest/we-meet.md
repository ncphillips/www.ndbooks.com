The singular work of Kenneth Patchen has influenced poets, artists and political activists for decades. New Directions is proud to launch a Patchen revival beginning with omnibus editions of his unique compositions. _We Meet_ highlights Patchen’s more outlandish side and includes, like fabrics stitched into a crazy quilt, _Because It Is_, _A Letter to God_, _Poemscapes_, _Hurrah For Anything_, and _Aflame & Afun of Walking Faces_. "Because to understand one must begin somewhere," opens Patchen’s fabulous book of poems Because It Is: perhaps the most ideal reason for such a melting pot of poetry. Open any page at random and find Patchen protesting the Second World War (_A Letter to God_), or telling the tale of how hot water first came to be tracked onto bedroom floors (_Aflame and Afun of Walking Faces_), or informing the reader what happened when the nervous vine wouldn’t twine (_Because It Is_), or why he loathes those who act as if a cherry were something they personally thought up (_Hurrah For Anything_), or answering what he wants out of life: "let’s say—no matter" (_Poemscapes_).
