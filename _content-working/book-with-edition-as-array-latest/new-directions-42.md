_New Directions in Prose & Poetry_ is an ongoing experiment in publishing. For nearly half a century, it has presented to the adventurous reader unusual foreign works in English translation and new writing by both the established and the unknown on the American literary scene. From abroad, _ND42_ contains impressionistic prose by Yves Bonnefoy (France), and stories by Russell Haley (New Zealand), Uchida Hyakken (Japan), and Isabella Wai (Canada), as well as poems by János Pilinszky (Hungary), Ganga Prasad Vimal (India), and the late British poet and fiction writer Sylvia Townsend Warner. Octavio Paz in Mexico City and Charles Tomlinson in Gloucestershire present "Airborn," a set of sonnets composed collaboratively via airmail. From the United States, Lawrence Ferlinghetti’s "Third Populist Manifesto––Modern Poetry Is Prose (But Is Saying Plenty)" again confronts the work of his compatriots. Poems are also contributed by Betsy Adams, Janine Canan, Andrea Moorhead, Michael Mott, Julia Older, Will Staple, and Wayne Westlake. Paul West offers an autobiographical meditation entitled "Gargoyles," and there is fiction by Carol Emshwiller, Walter Howerton, James McManus, and Harriet Zinnes. Also featured in _ND42_ is a selection made by exiled Estonian poet Aleksis Rannit of drawings by writers––Proust, Shaw, and Twain among others––from the Norman Holmes Pearson Collection at the Beinecke Library.
