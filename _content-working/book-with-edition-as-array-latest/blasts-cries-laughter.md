Lawrence Ferlinghetti’s _Blasts_ contains blasts, blessings, and curses in the vortex of today, taking its cues from the original little magazine, _Blast_ (published by Wyndham Lewis with Ezra Pound in 1914–15), which helped create the modernist movement in literature and the visual arts. Ferlinghetti speaks for the poor, the forgotten, the beaten, and the bombed.

> And speak to us in the poet’s voice 
> the voice of the people mixed
> with a wild soft laughter —
