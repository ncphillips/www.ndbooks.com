Here for a new generation of readers and students are two major poetic works of Robinson Jeffers (1887-1962). The verse narrative _Cawdor_, set on the ruthless California coast which Jeffers knew so well, tells a simple tale: an aging widower, Cawdor, unwilling to relinquish his youth, knowingly marries a young girl who does not love him. She falls in love with his son, Hood, and the narrative unfolds in tragedy of immense proportions. _Medea_ is a verse adaptation of Euripides’ drama and was created especially for the actress Judith Anderson. Their combined genius made the play one of the outstanding successes of the 1940’s. In _Medea_, Jeffers relentlessly drove toward what Ralph Waldo Emerson had called the proper tragic element-terror. _Cawdor_ and _Medea_ embody Jeffers’ most compelling themes and moods and convey his philosophy of “Inhumanism.”
