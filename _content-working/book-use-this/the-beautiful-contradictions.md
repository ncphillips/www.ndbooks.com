_The Beautiful Contradictions_ is an awe-inspiring vortex of mythology, history, and anthropology that pushes the lyric to its upper limit. A vast ecopoem for a dying Earth, a socially radical poem, a matrilineal drama, a Judeo-Mayan-Buddhist initiation, a transatlantic epic ending as a transamerican arrival, a testament uniting science and imagination.

> It takes a long time to bring to poetry
> whatever sears the spirits of any particular age
> when each letter each word each comma must pass
> each breath be submitted to interminable tests
> so what we have now is the age of song dead
