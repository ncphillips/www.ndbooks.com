Hugh MacDiarmid’s _Selected Poetry_ is an invaluable introduction to the work of a major poet who, despite the enthusiasm of T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, remains little known in the United States. MacDiarmid (1892-1978), universally recognized as the greatest Scottish poet since Robert Burns and the man responsible for reviving Scots as a literary language, was also the author of an enormous body of poems in English. As the noted critic and translator Eliot Weinberger writes of MacDiarmid’s work in his introduction: “There is nothing like it in modern literature, nothing even close. It is an attempt to return poetry to its original role as repository for all that a culture knows about itself.” Edited by Alan Riach and the poet’s son Michael Grieve, the _Selected Poetry_ draws generously from fifty years of work, and includes the complete text of MacDiarmid’s 1926 masterpiece, “A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle.”
