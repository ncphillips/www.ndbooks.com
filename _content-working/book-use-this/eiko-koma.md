For over thirty years, Eiko & Koma, the Japanese-born choreographers and dancers, have created an influential theatre of movement out of stillness, shape, light, and sound. In tribute and collaboration, the acclaimed American poet Forrest Gander has written a mesmerizing series of poems — hinging around a dance schematic — that captures and extends the dancers’ performance with lyrical intensity and vividness.

>            and seared straw in their hair hold our looking
>                        to the dark back of and beyond
