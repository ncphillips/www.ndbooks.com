Paul Auster has earned international praise for the imaginative power of his many novels, including _The New York Trilogy_, _Moon Palace_, _The Music of Chance_, _Mr. Vertigo_, and _Timbuktu_. He has also published a number of highly original nonfiction works: _The Invention of Solitude_, _Hand to Mouth_, and _The Art of Hunger_. In _The Red Notebook_, Auster again explores events from the real world – large and small, tragic and comic – that reveal the unpredictable, shifting nature of human experience. A burnt onion pie, a wrong number, a young boy struck by lightning, a man falling off a roof, a scrap of paper discovered in a Paris hotel room – all these form the context for a singular kind of ars poetica, a literary manifesto without theory, cast in the irreducible forms of pure storytelling.
