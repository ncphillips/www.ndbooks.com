Translated into fifty languages, the poetry of Tomas Tranströmer has had a profound influence around the world, an influence that has steadily grown and has now attained a prominence comparable to that of Pablo Neruda’s during his lifetime. But if Neruda is blazing fire, Tranströmer is expanding ice. _The Great Enigma: New Collected Poems_ gathers all the poems Tomas Tranströmer has published, from his distinctive first collection in 1954, _17 Poems_, through his epic poem _Baltics_ ("my most consistent attempt to write music"), and _The Sad Gondola_, published six years after he suffered a debilitating stroke in 1990 ("I am carried in my shadow / like a violin / in its black case."), to his most recent slim book, _The Great Enigma_, published in Sweden in 2004. Also included is his prose-memoir _Memories Look at Me_, containing keys into his intensely spiritual, metaphysical poetry (like the brief passage of insect collecting on Runmarö Island when he was a teenager). Firmly rooted in the natural world, his work falls between dream and dream; it probes "the great unsolved love" with the opening up, through subtle modulations, of "concrete words."
