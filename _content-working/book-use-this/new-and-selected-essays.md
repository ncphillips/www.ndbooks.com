Denise Levertov’s _New & Selected Essays_ gathers three decades’ worth of the poet’s most important critical statements. Her subjects are various-––poetics, the imagination, politics, spirituality, other writers––and her approach independent minded and richly complex. Here in a single volume are recent essays exploring new ground broken by Levertov in the past decade as well as the finest and most useful prose pieces from _The Poet in the World_ (1973) and _Light Up the Cave_ (1981). This is a book to read and reread. With their combination of sensitivity and practicality, the _New & Selected Essays_ will prove enormously helpful to the writer and reader of poetry. As _Kirkus Reviews_ remarked about her prose: "This is humanism in its true sense––her attitude as evidenced (not described) by her writing is such that the reader cannot help but experience life, at least temporarily, with more intensity, joy, and imagination."
