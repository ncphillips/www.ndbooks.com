_Fifteen Iraqi Poets_ compiles fifteen poems, each written by a prominent twentieth century Iraqi poet. Selected, with commentary, by the award-winning Iraqi-American poet Dunya Mikhail, this little anthology is the perfect introduction to a glorious literature that traces its roots back to ancient Sumer — a poetry written in a state of continuous wars and massacres, where laments often open with a plea to the destroyed homeland: “O Iraq."
