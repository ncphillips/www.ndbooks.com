_Minding the Darkness_ is the final volume of Peter Dale Scott’s landmark trilogy _Seculum_. Following _Coming to Jakarta_ and _Listening to the Candle_, it brings stunning, triumphant conclusion to a remarkable and sui generis poem. "There is nothing quite like these books," as the _American Book Review_ remarked: "Scott’s trilogy, only two-thirds completed as yet, is certain to be one of the most remarkable and challenging works of our rime." Scott’s hypnotic epic poem concerns the political and the personal, and their darkly powerful relationships. With its riveting images, Poundian collage, tight three-line stanzas, and eerie, accumulated juxtapositions, _Minding the Darkness_ fully hears out James Laughlin’s opinion that “Not since Robert Duncan’s _Groundwork_ and before that William Carlos Williams _Paterson_, has New Directions published a long poem as important as Peter Dale Scott’s.”
