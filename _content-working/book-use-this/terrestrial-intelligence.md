_Terrestrial Intelligence_ gathers the best new ground-breaking fiction from around the world, from W. G. Sebald ("one of the most gripping writers imaginable," _The New York Review of Books_) and Roberto Bolaño ("his generation’s premier Latin-American writer, [his] reputation and legend are in meteoric ascent," _The New York Times_) to the Russian enfant terrible Victor Pelevin and the astonishing Yoko Tawada. Not to be missed are the pleasures of Antonio Tabucchi ("the most original voice in the new generation of Italian writers," _The Harvard Book Review_), Javier Marías ("Spain’s best bait for the Nobel Prize," _The New York Sun_) and Yoel Hoffmann ("Israel’s avant-garde genius," _Forward_). These are just a few of the two dozen fascinating new writers brought to you in wonderful translations, all on one plate, in _Terrestrial Intelligence_. Take a trip around the world—Argentina, Brazil, Cape Verde, Chile, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Guatemala, Hungary, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Russia, and Spain—and sample the intelligence: we guarantee you will never look at these countries the same way again. New Directions—"long struggling and long astonishing," as Richard Eder put it in _The New York Times_—is always busy presenting what people in other countries are reading: these are riches which resonate in _Terrestrial Intelligence_ from story to story, like art hanging in an international biennale. These two showcase anthologies are convenient samplers, designed to push the wealth of the New Directions’ list as a whole into a more public view. "It would be nice to think," as James Laughlin, founder of New Directions wrote to Ernest Hemingway in 1950, "that virtue met its reward without exterior pushes, but it just ain’t so."
