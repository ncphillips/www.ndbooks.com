“Marvin Cohen’s wacky humor,” the late Thomas Merton once said, “has something of ’Thurber, something of Steinberg, Buster Keaton, the surrealists, the French pataphysicians." And this in itself is a fair enough assessment, to say the very least, of _The Monday Rhetoric of the Love Club_, a collection of twenty-one of the prolific Cohen’s parables, prose poems, fables, and dialogues. Two of the pieces, including the title story, originally appeared in the _New Directions in Prose and Poetry_ series; most of the others were selected from the many other magazines and anthologies in England and the United States in which Cohen’s shorter works have been published.
