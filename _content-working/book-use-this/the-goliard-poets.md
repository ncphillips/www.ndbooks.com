These mocking, irreverent verses, written in Latin by the vagabond scholars of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, furnish a wittingly vineous, commentary on the social and moral climate of medieval Europe. Whether Golias was the biblical giant Goliath or a personification of the sin of gluttony (Gula) matters little: these rolicking ballads which students still sing in the beer-cellars are a joy for all time.
