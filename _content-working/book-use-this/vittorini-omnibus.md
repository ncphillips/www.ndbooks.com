This representative collection of works by the late Elio Vittorini (1908-1966) brings under a single cover three short novels. _The Twilight of the Elephant_ (_II Sempione strizza l’occhio al Fréjus_, 1946) is a haunting, mythlike tale bearing strong affinities with music and abstract art. It is the story of a poverty-stricken family and its extraordinary grandfather––a veritable "elephant" of a man. One of the recognized classics of modern literature, _In Sicily_ (_Conversazione in Sicilia_, 1937) recounts a city man’s rediscovery of himself and the basic values of life when he returns for a visit to the primitive Sicilian village where he was born. Included in this edition is an introduction written in 1949 by Ernest Hemingway, who greatly admired Vittorini. The third novella, _La Garibaldina_ (1950), is a vivid portrait of an eccentric old woman, a former camp follower of Garibaldi’s army, and her encounter with a young soldier on a night-train journey across Sicily.
