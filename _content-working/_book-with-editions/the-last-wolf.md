_The Last Wolf_ features a classic, obsessed Krasznahorkai narrator, a man hired to write (by mistake, by a glitch of fate) the true tale of the last wolf of Extremadura, a barren stretch of Spain. This miserable experience (being mistaken for another, dragged about a cold foreign place, appalled by a species’ end) is narrated— _all in a single sentence_—as a sad looping tale, a howl more or less, in a dreary wintry Berlin bar to a patently bored bartender.

_The Last Wolf_ is Krasznahorkai in a maddening nutshell—with the narrator trapped in his own experience (having internalized the extermination of the last creature of its kind and “ _locked Extremadura in the depths of his own cold, empty, hollow heart_ ”)—enfolding the reader in the exact same sort of entrapment to and beyond the end, with its first full-stop period of the book.
