Clarice Lispector’s first novel, _Near to the Wild Heart_ (_Perto do coraçao selvagem_), was published in 1944, when its author was only nineteen years old. An immediate success, it became an acknowledged watershed in Brazilian literature, catapulting it into the literary arena of European modernism. Narrative epiphanies and interior monologue consciously echo James Joyce as Lispector recalls first the childhood and then the adult years of the middle-class Joana, her unhappy marriage and its dissolution. _Near to the Wild Heart_––which won Brazil’s Prêmio do Fundaçao Graça Aranha––is a brilliant psychological and stylistic tour de force that anticipates the complex themes of one of Latin America’s foremost woman writers.
