Written at various times over the last twenty-five years but never produced, the four scripts included in Tennessee Williams’s _Stopped Rocking and Other Screenplays_ encompass both the realistic style of "the early Williams" (the author’s quotes) and the more experimental dramatic devices of many of his "later" plays. Two screenplays from the fifties, _All Gaul Is Divided_ and _The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond_, remained in the files of Williams’s New Orleans apartment until a thorough cleaning uncovered them in the mid-seventies. Thus, _All Gaul_, an expanded version of the story of a St. Louis teacher’s dreams of love told in _A Lovely Sunday for Creve Coeur_ (1978) actually predates that play. A companion piece in mood and style, _The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond_ lyrically evokes the late twenties debutante society of Memphis and the Delta plantations. Adapted from the graphic short story of the same name, _One Arm_ concerns a young male hustler awaiting execution for murder. Because much of the visual action is combined with a voice-over narration, Williams considered the form of this "film-play" from the late sixties somewhat experimental. In _Stopped Rocking_ (1977), Williams returns to a familiar theme, the institution as the last haven of those who cannot cope with daily conflict and have "resigned from life." He was confident that this play, like so many of his others, would eventually find its audience: "I know that the ’dark’ of the work is more than balanced by its humanity, and that this light of humanity will tip the balance favorably, as a natural act of grace.”
