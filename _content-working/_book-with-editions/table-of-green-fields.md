From Library Journal:

"Connoisseurs of art, history, religion, and literature will revel in this fine collection of ten stories by one of America’s most erudite writers. Although the tone is often playful, Davenport layers each story with a variety of allusions and rather obscure meanings that perhaps only the most scholarly readers will fully appreciate. A wonderful example is "Meleager,’’ in which the sexual play of two boys is juxtaposed with descriptions of geometry. Another is "And,’’ a snippet (nine paragraphs) of a parable in which Jesus scatters seeds on a river. More satisfying are the longer tales, especially "O Gadjo Niglo,’’ a touching love story told by Eros, and "Gunner and Nikolai,’’ with its surprise ending. Male sexuality is the predominant theme, one the author presents with light but clearly serious intent. The title--a story in itself--is taken from Falstaff’s dying vision, inspired by the 23rd Psalm. It makes a most fitting symbol for this most unusual and imaginative collection. Highly recommended."
