_Vale Ave_ — Latin for “Farewell, Hail” — is a hymn to Eros that unfolds as a gorgeous palimpsest of eternal recurrence and reincarnation, charting the course of two lovers who each seek the other across cultures, myths, and centuries. _Vale Ave_ is alchemical — “mystery and portent, yes, but at the same time,” as H. D. writes, “there is Resurrection and the hope of Paradise.”

> Ave and vale but the parting came
> before the greeting, it was vale, ave,
> keep the wine till the last,
> I hold this cup, I need not taste this sleep
