A meditation on the nature of life and time, _Água Viva_ (1973) shows Lispector discovering a new means of writing about herself, more deeply transforming her individual experience into a universal poetry. In a body of work as emotionally powerful, formally innovative, and philosophically profound as Clarice Lispector’s, _Água Viva_ stands out as a particular triumph.
