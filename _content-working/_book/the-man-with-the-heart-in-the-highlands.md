Gathered in _The Man with the Heart in the Highlands_ are sixteen stories from William Saroyan’s most celebrated literary period, culled from several long out-of-print collections from the 1930s and ’40s, While achieving meteoric success with _The Human Comedy_ and _The Time of Your Life_, the young Saroyan set the pace with characters as fresh and compassionate as himself. His voice here is exhilarating, luminous, and completely distinctive––ready to let go with a lusty brash laugh on every page. These stories amply bear out Elizabeth Bowen’s opinion that "probably since O. Henry nobody has done more to endear and stabilize the short story."
