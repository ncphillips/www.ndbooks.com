_The Theatre of Tennessee Williams_ brings together in a matching format the plays of one of Americas most influential and innovative dramatists. Arranged in chronological order, this ongoing series includes the original cast listings and production notes. _Volume Ill_ of the series includes _Cat on a Hot Tin Roof_ (1955), _Orpheus Descending_ (1957), and _Suddenly Last Summer_ (1958). The first, which won both the Pulitzer Prize and Drama Critics Award, has proved every bit as successful as Williamâ€™s earlier _A Streetcar Named Desire_. The other two plays, though different in kind, both have something of the quality of Greek tragedy in 20th-century settings, bringing about catharsis through ritual death.
