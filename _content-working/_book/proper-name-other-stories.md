_Proper Name_ collects for the first time the inimitable stories of Bernadette Mayer––"one of the most original writers of her generation" (_The Washington Post_). The nineteen narratives of _Proper Name_ include "My Excellent Novel," "Ice Cube Epigrams," "Essay: How Carefully Do We Tend?" and "Juan Gave Nora a Pomegranate." Mayer’s structural inventions are terrific and unique. As Fanny Howe remarked in _The American Book Review_, "In a language made up of idiom and lyricism, Mayer cancels the boundaries between prose and poetry."
