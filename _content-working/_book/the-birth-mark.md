Susan Howe reads our intellectual inheritance as a series of civil wars, where each text is a series of battlefields on which a strange lawless author confronts interpreters and editors eager for settlement.

Howe approaches Anne Hutchinson, Mary Rowlandson, Cotton Mather, Hawthorne, Emerson, Melville, and Emily Dickinsonâ€”as a poet-scholar. Her insights, fierce and original, are rooted in her seminal textural scholarship in examining the editorial histories of landmark works. In the process, Howe uproots settled institutionalized roles of men and women as well as of poetry and prose. _The Birth-mark_, first published in the mid-1990s and now published in tandem with her new selected essays, _The Quarry_, joins the New Directions canon of a dozen Susan Howe titles.
