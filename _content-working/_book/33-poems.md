The American poet Robert Lax belongs to the generation of William Burroughs, John Cage and of the Abstract Expressionist painters. In the past twenty-five years he has become known as an Abstract poet to an ever-widening circle of writers and artists in America and abroad. Lax gained his own position through a constant questioning of the universe and our ideas of it. His poetry has varied from fables and parables to clear-cut columns of basic words, from the account of a circus day as a vision of creation to an insistent description of his own search for truth. Portions of Lax’s correspondence with his lifelong friend Thomas Merton, the Trappist monk, appeared as _A Catch of Anti-Letters_. _33 Poems_ presents the first quintessential gathering of Lax’s work. It includes several long poems like _The Circus of the Sun_ and _Sea & Sky_ in their entirety.
