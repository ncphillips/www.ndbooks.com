A powerful selection of Susan Howe's previously uncollected essays, _The Quarry_ moves backward chronologically, from her brand-new "Vagrancy in the Park" (about Wallace Stevens) through such essential texts as "The Disappearance Approach," "Personal Narrative," "Sorting Facts; or, 47 Ways of Looking at Chris Marker," "Frame Structures," and "Where Should the Commander Be" to end with her seminal early art criticism, "The End of Art."

Taken together, _The Quarry_ and _The Birth-mark <span class="redactor-invisible-space"></span>_(published in tandem) map the intellectual territory of one of America's most important poets.
