_The Theatre of Tennessee Williams_ presents, in matching format, the plays of one of America’s most consistently influential and innovative dramatists. The first five volumes of this ongoing series contain Williams’s full-length plays through 1975 and, in addition to the texts themselves, include original cast listings and production notes. _Volumes 6_ and _7_ contain Williams’s collected shorter plays. Now available as a paperback, _Volume 8_ adds to the series four full-length plays written and produced during the last decade of Williams’s life.
