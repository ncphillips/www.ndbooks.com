The writings in Thalia Field’s long-awaited new book, _Point and Line_, wonderfully defy categorization. Perhaps describable as "epic poetries," they represent a confluence of genres (fiction, theater, and poetry) in which Thalia Field has been involved over the course of her career. Written from a constructivist, post-genre sensibility, eluding classification, Field’s work presents her concerns with clarity in a world that resists it. Some pieces use generative schemes, portraits of mental shapes, which create meaning out of noise. In "Hours" and "Setting, the Table," Field uses indeterminate performance techniques to emphasize the categorical/conceptual nature of thought. Visually, each chapter is captivating, showing both the author’s need for shapes and colors in her work, and her fascination with the contours of speech.
