It is a very short list of 20th-century American plays that continue to have the same power and impact as when they first appeared—_A Streetcar Named Desire_ is one of those plays. The story of the fading and desperate Blanche DuBois and how her sensuous and brutal brother-in-law, Stanley Kowalski, pushes her over the edge is now classic. Who better than Arthur Miller, America’s elder statesman of the theater (_Death of a Salesman, The Crucible, A View from the Bridge, Broken Glass, Resurrection Blues_), to write as a witness to the lightning that struck American culture when Williams’s singular style of poetic dialogue, violence, compassion, and dramatic sexuality was first encountered in the form of _A Streetcar Named Desire_? Miller’s rich perspective and lucid insights make this a unique and essential new edition. Included are Williams’s essay "The World I Live In" and a chronology of the author’s life and works.
