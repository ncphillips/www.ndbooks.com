Corman is one of modernism’s enduring masters, a poet of prodigious talent and production whose work, both as poet and publisher, is intertwined with the Objectivists Louis Zukofsky and George Oppen, as well as the Black Mountain poets Robert Creeley and Charles Olson. Among those many giants, Corman’s verse is perhaps the most committed to the sublime, refusing the temptation of "effect" for the tactile ink of line and "touch." _Nothing/Doing_ presents a vital poetry of Zen koan and cognitive conundrum, but also one of uncompromising wisdom, where Corman can definitively declare: "There’s only/one poem:/ this is it."
