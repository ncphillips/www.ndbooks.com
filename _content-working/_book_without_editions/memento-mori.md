Their geriatric leathers are soon thoroughly ruffled by these perhaps supernatural phone calls, and in the resulting flurry many old secrets are dusted off. Cracks appear on the once decorous surface of their lives––unsavories like blackmail and adultery are now to be glimpsed. Spooky, poignant and wickedIy hilarious, _Memento Mori_ may deal in death, but it is a book which leaves one relishing life all the more.
