Christopher Isherwood was only twenty-one when he began his first novel, _All the Conspirators_, in 1926; it was published in England two years later. In his introduction to the first American edition (published by New Directions in 1958), Isherwood explains: "_All the Conspirators_ records a minor engagement in what Shelley calls ‘the great war between the old and young.’ And what a war it was!"

_All the Conspirators_ (like the classic _Berlin Stories_) grows out of a particular historical situation—the transformation of English life after WWI—but it is also the story of a young artist defying his mother's expectation that he will pursue a conventional middle-class profession. Isherwood’s portrayal of this passionate struggle is psychologically astute and subtly chilling.
