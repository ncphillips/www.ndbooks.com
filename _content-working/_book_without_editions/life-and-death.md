In 1999 Robert Creeley received the prestigious Bollingen Prize in Poetry, and was elected a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets. Both honors made specific note of his experimental style, his long influence, and his ongoing importance. Robert Creeley’s stature has been further confirmed by a Lifetime Achievement Award conferred by the Before Columbus Foundation as part of its American Book Awards 2000\. Creeley’s 1998 collection, _Life & Death_, now available as a New Directions Paperbook, is a high point in a career that has poignantly combined “linguistic abstraction with specificity of time and place” (R. D. Pohl, _Buffalo News_).
