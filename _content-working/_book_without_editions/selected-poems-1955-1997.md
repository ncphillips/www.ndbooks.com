Presenting Charles Tomlinson’s finest poems, this edition of _Selected Poems_ provides perfect entry into the work of one of England’s contemporary masters. Rendering with remarkable precision the response of the poet to the surfaces and depths of things as well as the world of historical necessity, Tomlinson’s poems embody aspects of both tragedy and possibility. William Carlos Williams once said, "[Tomlinson’s poetry] gives a refreshing rustle or seething to the words which bespeak the entrance of a new life." Finally, here is the long-awaited compendium of the work of one of this century’s great poets.
