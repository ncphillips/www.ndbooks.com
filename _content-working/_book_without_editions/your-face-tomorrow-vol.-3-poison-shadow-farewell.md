A spectacular finale, _Poison, Shadow and Farewell_ brings to a close Javier Marías’s daring, unfolding three-part novel _Your Face Tomorrow_. Marías’s magnum opus has already been acclaimed "exquisite" (_Publishers Weekly_), "gorgeous" (_Kirkus_), and "outstanding: another work of urgent originality" (London Independent). With its heightened tensions between meditations and noir narrative, _Poison, Shadow and Farewell_ takes our hero, Jacques Deza––hired by a shady branch of M16 as a person of perception––back to Madrid to spy on and try to protect his own family, as he plunges into new depths of love and loss.
