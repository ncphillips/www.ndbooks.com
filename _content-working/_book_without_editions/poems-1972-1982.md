Here, for the first time in a single edition, are three of Denise Levertov’s finest books: _The Freeing of the Dust_ (1975), _Life in the Forest_ (1978), and _Candles in Babylon_ (1982). This new compilation – beginning where Denise Levertov’s _Poems 1968-1972_ left off– testifies not only to Levertov’s technical mastery, but also to her spiritual vision. Some of Levertov’s best war poems, the result of her visit to North Vietnam in 1972, are contained in this marvelous collection. _Poems 1972-1982_ enables readers to observe a crucial phase in Levertov’s poetic development. At the same time, it illuminates Robert Creeley’s assessment that she "was a constantly defining presence in the world we shared, a remarkable and transforming poet for all of us."
