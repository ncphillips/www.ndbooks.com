Born in 1951 in Mexico City, Coral Bracho has published half a dozen books of poems including the groundbreaking _El ser que va a morir_ (1982) which changed the course of Mexican poetry. Her exquisite long-lined poems evoke the sensual realm where logic is disbanded, wonder evoked. In the words of her translator Forrest Gander, "Her diction spills out along ceaselessly shifting beds of sound...Bracho’s poems make sense first as music, and music propels them." From her early collections--_Bajo el destello liguido and El ser_—to her most recent books _La voluntad del ambar_ and _Ese espacio_, _ese jardin_ (which won the Xavier Villaurrutia Prize), _Firefly Under the Tongue_ offers the first book of English translations by this most important and influential living poet
