A Russian train which makes no stops, the _Yellow Arrow_ has no end and no beginning, and its destination is a ruined bridge. Andrei, less and less lulled by the never-ending hum of the wheels, begins to look for a way to escape. But life in the carriages goes on as always. "Indifferent to their fate, the passengers carry on as usual––trading in nickel melted down from the carriage doors, attending the Upper Bunk avant-garde theatre, leafing through Pasternak’s _Early Trains_, or disposing of their dead through the compartment windows” (_The London Observer_).
