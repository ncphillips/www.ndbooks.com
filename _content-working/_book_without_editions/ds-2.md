In _DS (2)_—_Dreamstories 2_—Kamau Brathwaite continues his ongoing collection of prose poems, comprised of the broken images, flow, and half-told stories of dreams. The poetic stories in _DS (2)_ use Brathwaite’s trademark sycorax video style, offering personal revelations mixed with political and historical fables occurring around the globe. Brathwaite’s prose poems relate with ardency and pathos the Caribbean experience and are a potent voice of the African diaspora. Nathaniel Mackey wrote: "Kamau Brathwaite’s ’calibanic play’ reveals a fiendish delight in the slippage to which words are prone." And _American Book Review_ wrote: "In its rhythms as well as its explorations of ’nation language’ and of the traces of an African past, this is a populist work." This exciting new offering by Kamau Brathwaite follows on the heels of the publication of Brathwaite’s _Born to Slow Horses_, which won the coveted 2006 Griffin Poetry Prize. "To read Kamau Brathwaite is to enter into an entire world of human histories and natural histories, beautiful landscapes and their destruction, children’s street songs, high lyricism, court documents, personal letters, literary criticism, sacred rites, eroticism and violence, the dead and the undead, confession and reportage...Brathwaite has invented a new linguistic music for subject matter that is all his own."—Citation for the 2006 Griffin Poetry Prize
