_Never Love a Gambler_ is a showcase for the exceptional talents of Keith Ridgway. The _Times_ (London) praised his stories as “flawlessly structured yarns told in lovingly crafted prose.” Ridgway’s characters negotiate their way through love, madness, lust, anger, religious obsession, crime, and absence in stories told with innovative mastery and brightened by fiercely vivid dialogues. _Never Love a Gambler_ is a mental rust-remover: refreshing, bracing, and often violently funny.
