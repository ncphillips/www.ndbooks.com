At five to seven, a small group including Peter and Susan were chatting at the cafe upstairs while a large crowd below fidgeted with anticipation.\n\n\n\tPeter read from his new collection The Invention of Influence. Susan read from her new book Spontaneous Particulars: The Telepathy of Archives, co-published by New Directions and Christine Burgin. The audience listened from the seats, the floor, and the steps. After hearing Peter and Susan read their lines live, one does not read their poetry the same way again. \n\n\n\tThe readings were followed by an illuminating discussion, led by The Poetry Society's Alice Quinn. Peter discussed his discovery of Freud's disciple Victor Tausk. Susan explained her obsession with archives, Hart Crane, and Henry James (\"my beloved\"). \n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\tPhotographs by Jesse Ruddock.\n\n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     100 years of James Laughlin: a celebration of his life and work\n  \n  \n    A Desk in Moscow \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Dylan Thomas…touched down at Idlewild Airport…”\n\n        \n\n      Today is the centenary of the birth of Dylan Thomas. Yesterday a live reading of Under Milk Wood, his \"radio play for voices,\" was performed in New York City. First commissioned by the BBC and broadcast in 1954, it has been performed by Anthony Hopkins, Richard Burton, Tom Jones, Elton John, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Elizabeth Taylor, Peter O’Toole, and many others. This centenary performance took place at the 92nd Street Y’s Kaufmann Music Hall, the same venue the hilarious play had its debut.\n\nThis is how William Grimes of The New York Times described Thomas’s first appearance in the US: \"A poetic comet streaked across American skies in the winter of 1950. Dylan Thomas, invited by the Poetry Center at the 92nd Street Y, touched down at Idlewild Airport and headed straight for the airport bar to get a much-needed double Scotch and soda. Then, without further ado, he set about seducing audiences from coast to coast.\"\n\nYou can listen to the full performance, from October 26, 2014, starring and directed by Michael Sheen on the 92nd Street Y website. The Dylan Thomas in America Centennial Exhibition is also open at the 92nd Street Y till December.

The examples are so numerous and so obvious as to all but go without needing mention, beginning with my first chapbook, dedicated to John Coltrane, taking its title from Archie Shepp’s album Four for Trane and extending to particular musicians and pieces of music being said to be “on the box” in my ongoing serial poems Song of the Andoumboulou and “Mu,” each of which takes its title from a piece of recorded music. The instances or examples are nowhere more numerous or more obvious than in my ongoing epistolary fiction From a Broken Bottle Traces of Perfume Still Emanate, comprised of letters written by composer/multi-instrumentalist N., founding member of the band Molimo m’Atet, formerly known as the Mystic Horn Society, the East Bay Dread Ensemble and the Deconstructive Woodwind Chorus. N. frequently refers to recorded music that inspires and instructs him and the other members of the band. \n\nIn 2010, when New Directions reissued the first three volumes, Bedouin Hornbook, Djbot Baghostus’s Run and Atet A.D., as From a Broken Bottle Traces of Perfume Still Emanate: Volumes 1-3, my editor Jeffrey Yang suggested compiling and including a discography of these references, which I did. Michael Barron recently suggested doing the same for volume four in the series, Bass Cathedral. That discography follows, along with a 90-minute music mix that I programmed, comprised of eighteen tracks that appear on it. The latter samples not only the discography, Bass Cathedral’s soundscape, but my former life as a radio disc jockey, beginning as an undergraduate at Princeton University’s WPRB and including nearly thirty years at Santa Cruz’s KUSP.  I’ve said before and I’ll end by saying again that I’ve long felt similarities between the processes of selection, sequencing, juxtaposition, pacing, transition, etc. that putting a radio program together entails and those involved in writing prose, writing poetry and editing my journal Hambone. —NM\n\n* * *\n\nThe following is a discography of music referred to in Bass Cathedral (From a Broken Bottle Traces of Perfume Still Eminate, Volume 4).

He was 88.\n\nBreon Mitchell, in his introduction to Lenz’s Selected Stories, remembers the writer’s acceptance speech for the 1989 Heinz Galinski Foundation Prize: \"Lenz spoke again of memory and imagination as a ’defense against the indifference of history,’ and announced that he would donate the substantial award he received to a home for the aged in Jerusalem. Then he prepared to depart, as he does each summer, for a small fisherman’s cottage on the Danish island of Alsen, where for several years now he has painstakingly produced his stories at a rate of three pages a day.\" \n\nNew Directions remembers Siegfried Lenz through his stories, novels—especially The German Lesson—and translations. And we share \"A Love Story\" by Siegfried Lenz, translated by Breon Mitchell, below. \n\n\n\nEmil Nolde\n\n \n\n \n\nA Love Story \n\n \n\nJoseph Waldemar Gritzan, a tall, taciturn woodcutter, had been stricken by love. And it wasn’t just a skinny arrow lodged in his back, but, in keeping with his line of work, a full-sized woodman’s ax. The ax hit him the moment he saw Katharina Knack, an unusually healthy, rosy-faced young girl, washing clothes. She was down on her pretty knees by the side of the stream, bending over, a stray hair or two in her flushed face, while her imposing arms dealt splendidly with the wash. At that moment, as we’ve said, Joseph Gritzan was walking by, and the ax was in his back before he knew what hit him.\n        As a consequence he didn’t go into the woods, but instead wound up around five in the morning at the pastor’s house in Suleyken. He roused the man from his bed by drumming at the door, and said, “Pastor, I’ve got a notion to get married. So I’d like a certificate of baptism.”\n        The pastor, rudely awakened from sweet dreams, looked at Joseph Gritzan somewhat less than graciously and said, “My son, if love won’t let you sleep, at least let others do so. Come back after breakfast. But if you have time, you can dig up the garden. The spade’s in the stable.”\n        The woodcutter looked quickly over toward the stable and said, “When I’ve dug up the garden, can I have a certificate of baptism?”\n        “Everything will be taken care of in due course,” said the pastor, and took his leave.\n        Joseph Gritzan, encouraged by these words, went to work with the spade so energetically that the garden was dug up in no time. Then, after conferring again with the pastor, he placed wire rings in the pigs’ noses, milked a cow, picked two red-currant bushes clean, slaughtered a goose, and chopped a mountain of firewood.\n        Just as he was starting to repair the shed, the pastor called him inside, filled out the certificate of baptism, and handed it to Joseph Waldemar Gritzan along with various gentle admonitions. He folded the document slowly and carefully, wrapped it inside a page from the Masurian calendar, and put it away safely somewhere within the area of his massive chest. Offered his thanks of course, as was to be expected, and headed for the spot on the stream where love’s tender axe had struck him.\n        Katharina Knack still didn’t know the state he was in, nor did she have any idea how much he had already set secretly in motion. She knelt by the stream singing, pummeling and kneading the wash, from time to time allowing herself a view of her wholesome face in the river.\n        Joseph embraced her rosy form—with his eyes, of course—gasped for breath, swallowed and choked a while, and then, after he had finished swallowing, went up the small wooden dock where she was kneeling. He had thought long and hard about what he should say to her, and now that he was standing beside her, he said it: “Scoot over.”\n        It was certainly an unambiguous sentence. Katharina quickly made room for him on the dock, and he sat down beside her without another word. They sat there for, oh, maybe half an hour, being quite proper and saying nothing. They watched the river, and the woods on the opposite bank, observed the little smelt boring into the bottom of the stream, sending up small murky clouds, and occasionally looked at the ducks drifting along. All at once Joseph Gritzan spoke up: “The strawberries’ll be ready soon. N’ the blueberries in the woods.” The young girl wasn’t prepared for this speech, and jumped nervously before answering, “Yes.”\n        And then they sat there as quietly as hens, looking out across the meadow, gazing over at the woods, peering up at the sun once in a while, or scratching their feet or necks.\n        Then, after an appropriate length of time, another unusual thing happened. Joseph Gritzan reached into his pocket, took out something wrapped, and said to Katharina Knack, “Want some likrish?”\n        She nodded, and the woodcutter unwrapped two sticks of licorice, gave one to her, and watched her sucking it. She seemed to like it. She was in high spirits, but not so high that she actually said anything. She dangled her legs in the water, made little waves, and looked him in the face now and then. He didn’t take his shoes off.\n        Thus far everything had progressed in an orderly fashion. But all at once, as usually happens in such situations, old lady Guschke stepped out of her house and yelled, “Katinka, what’s holding up the wash?”\n        Whereupon the young girl sprang up in confusion, grabbed the bucket, and was about to disappear without more ado, as if the licorice stick had meant nothing. However, Joseph Gritzan had, thank God, already searched through the broad plains of his chest and found the certificate of baptism, which he now unwrapped carefully, waving the girl back to him.\n        “D’you read?” he said.\n        She nodded quickly.\n        He handed her the certificate and stood up. He watched her face as she read, his whole body trembling.\n        “Katinka!” yelled old Guschke, “Katinka, have the ducks eaten the wash?”\n        “Read it all,” the woodcutter said insistently. God knows, the fellow was already blocking her way.\n        Katharina Knack immersed herself more and more in the certificate, forgot the world and the wash, and stood there like, let’s say, a dreamy calf.\n        “Bring the wash, bring the wash,” old Guschke began to chide again.\n        “Read it all,” Joseph Gritzan insisted, and he was so excited that he didn’t even stop to wonder why he was talking so much.\n         Suddenly old Guschke shot out of the gooseberry bushes, a fast-moving, well-endowed woman, came right up to Katharina Knack, and demanded, “The wash, Katinka!” And giving the woodcutter her tartar’s look, she added, “She’s supposed to be washing clothes, for heaven’s sake!”\n        Oh, the wonder of love, especially of the Masurian variety. The dreamy, rosy-cheeked young girl lifted her chin, showed the certificate of baptism to old Guschke, and said, “It’s signed and sealed. What a beautiful baptismal certificate. I’m going to get married.” Old Guschke was stunned at first, but then she laughed and said, “Mercy! mercy! all the things that come in the wash. While it was soaking we didn’t know a thing. And now that it’s ready to iron, look what’s happened.”\n        Meanwhile Joseph Gritzan had pulled something out of his pocket again. He held it out to the young girl. “Want some more likrish?”\n\n \n\n \n\nSiegfried Lenz\n17 March 1926 – 7 October 2014 \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     The Doorway to Studio Paul Sahre\n  \n  \n    Postcard from Sebald \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Sahre is also the mind behind the dazzling new Muriel Spark covers, in which the great author emerges from jolts of near-fluorescent colors and panels of shadow in a nod to committed Sparkians and a bold hello to new readers.  \n\nI spoke with Paul in his office, just days before he moved his operation to a new space. His shelves—usually crammed with rare art books, design books, novels, graphic novels, and hobbyist manuals—were bare. In this oddly sparse setting, we discussed what makes a good book cover, the trap of Google Image searches, and the art of suggestion. \n\n\n\nMieke Chew: How did you start working with New Directions?\n\nPaul Sahre: Barbara came to me about re-running my cover for Omon Ra. A cover I originally did for Farrar, Straus and Giroux. It’s actually the first book cover I ever did, in 1996. It’s always been a favorite of mine, and I was thrilled she was interested in using it. That was about twelve years ago. Barbara put me in touch with Erik Rieselbach (New Directions Art Director) and it just went from there. I’ve always been, as many graphic designers are, a big fan of the New Directions covers from the ’50s and ’60s, the Alvin Lustig covers, and there were a few other designers of note.\n\nMC: Does your admiration for the books inform your design?\n\nPS: As designers we’re reading a lot. It’s a weird filter but I don’t read books that I’m not commissioned to do a cover for. I’m always reading outside the office, so it’s important to like what you’re designing. Most editors or creative directors who call me to do a book are already aware of my work. They know not to steer me toward the latest bestseller. Some of the painful books I’ve had to read over the years! It cures you quickly.\n\nMC: When you read, how are you having a visual response to the book? Does a cover start to form in your mind?\n\nPS: It can happen a lot of different ways. Early on, I was very diligent about post-its and highlighters. Often there’s very rich visual imagery already there. It can just be mechanically identifying those moments while you’re reading. But I don’t do that anymore. It’s gotten less about note taking and is more spontaneous. I know if there’s something I should pay attention to. It’s one of the most interesting design challenges, doing a book cover. I don’t care that much about a book selling, it’s not my job. I care more about it being a doorway to an experience.\n\nMC: What’s the difference between designing a poster and a book cover?\n\nPS: It’s a functional thing. You normally think about books as being at arm’s length. But, at a bookstore or even sitting on a coffee table you see these things at a distance and you either go up to that book or you don’t. Posters do that too. You typically see them from a way off and then you engage with them or you don’t. A graphic designer rarely has a captive audience. If you’re an architect, you’re in the building. Filmmakers have everyone sitting in a dark room. Graphic design is going by on a bus or it’s in a subway station. I started out doing posters for the theater. It’s almost the same thing as a book cover: the promise of an experience. It has to show you what you’re in for, without spelling it out.\n\nMC: Didn’t people steal your posters? \n\nPS: Oh yes they all got taken.\n\n\n\nMC: Where do you look for ideas, what do you reference?\n\nPS: I have a ridiculous one-of-a-kind book collection, which has a lot of fantastic reference material: books on how to make balsa wood airplanes, to encyclopedias of infectious rashes from the Vietnam War era. You never know what you’re going to find. Sometimes while you’re reading a book you just start looking at things. If you’re stumped, that’s one way to do it. I used to need to “make it happen” more. I’d go to the library and pull books off the shelves randomly without looking, and then I’d just look. It could be a book on the geography of the great lakes and there’s something in there visually that makes you go, “Oh yeah! I can use this.” So much design research now is Google image searches. I never go there for material because that’s where everyone else is going. A lot of the book covers I do are collaborations with designers as well. So it’s a different way of working than before. Sometimes we have two or three designers coming up with ideas and thinking about it. It’s very different to back in ’96.  \n\nMC: The cover for László Krasznahorkai’s Satantango is one of my favorites. By the end of the book it opens up and you can see: the graphics are a tango.\n\nPS: It’s also a literal reference to what the author’s doing in the book. The lines are a spider’s web. Sometimes it’s the most obvious thing… It could be the first page. I get satisfaction from paying close attention to things that might be super obvious.\n\nMC: How does that change when you design a series? In particular, the new Muriel Spark covers. These books are in many ways an introduction to Spark. The older covers were for people who already know and love her, but this is the shiny new Spark.\n\nPS: I have to find the email that Barbara sent. The way she describes what she’s hoping for with a cover or a series of covers, she often just writes one sentence and there’s three or four words put together that probably have never been put together before and it’s exactly what you need, other than reading the book itself. Part of it is what you were just describing, how it needs to feel new.\n\nMC: They are also a tribute to Spark.\n\nPS: Yes, and that happened with Clarice Lispector too. Often when I’m doing a series, I don’t know that it’s a series when I begin. Then you have to think about it retrospectively. With the Lispector and the Spark covers I knew it so my thinking shifted. It was more about introducing a generation of readers to an author they might not have known than introducing them to a book. It’s very different to doing a cover for a book, and responding to that one book. And, of course, Barbara loves Spark and that’s infectious.\n\n\n\nMC: How about the Poetry Pamphlets​?\n\nPS: We don’t have anything to read in these situations. We just have a title. So there is already an abstraction of what the book is. I try to have an understanding of why an author chose a title. There’s always a word or series of words that you’re confronted with. So we think of a visual we can bounce off. That’s different to Spark because we were paying homage to the author, so we played with time: we looked for photos of her from around the time she first published that particular book and we used that image on the cover. I can’t remember how many years these eight or nine books spanned, but we were working along her life. But with the pamphlets it was different. With Alejandra Pizarnik’s A Musical Hell, we just had that title so I put the harp at the bottom to indicate something descending into the lower region of things. And I like that it’s a harp. I mean, who wants to listen to a harp?\n\nMC: The cover for The Albertine Workout by Anne Carson is perfect because the whole premise of the pamphlet is that Albertine was actually based on Proust’s chauffeur Albert. The cover only features Proust’s eyes, and the effect is that they could belong to a man or a woman.\n\nPS: Laughs. I love that you’re reading things into this. For us, it was creating a sense of identity. You know how censors normally cover up the eyes? We wanted to reveal the eyes to draw you in. With Sylvia Legris’s Pneumatic Antiphonal, it was a kind of a paleo-future feel, the whole idea everyone had in the ’60s that in the future everything would be transported in pneumatic tubes. Now you only see them in banks.\n\nThese pamphlets are very much a studio project. We get the title and then we sit down and ask: what to do with this? For the Osip Mandelstam pamphlet, we had three objects we were playing with, and I have no idea why we ended up with this big rock. I mean, it sounds a little flip but I love the free association that can happen doing these things.\n\nMC: I like how the pamphlets seem like a troupe of like-minded things. That’s what is great about New Directions covers. They are all different, by different designers, with no clear formula, but they are harmonious and seem to work together as one. They look like New Directions books.\n\n\n\nPS: It’s rare these days for that to happen from the top down. It’s very much about Barbara and Erik not dictating things. But, at the same time, as I said, a few well-worded emails go along way. And again a number of designers that work for ND are doing a lot of work for them like myself. Rodrigo Corral is another example. We get a feel for the types of books.\n\nMC: Does that history of New Directions book covers become a restriction that you work within?\n\nPS: I guess a restriction in a good way. Absolutely. Design is all about a set of circumstances that are beyond your control. Hopefully you bring yourself into it somehow. I think the fascinating oil and water with design is that you can’t do whatever you want, but you have to do what you want at the same time. That’s the tension.\n\n \n\n \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     The Susan Howe Syllabus\n  \n  \n    Siegfried Lenz \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Thursdays 3:30-6:30 pm.\n\n \n\nThough we wander about,\nfind no honey of flowers in this waste,\nis our task the less sweet--\nwho recall the old splendour,\nawait the new beauty of cities?\n\nThe city is peopled\nwith spirits, not ghosts, O my love:\n\nThough they crowded between\nand usurped the kiss of my mouth\ntheir breath was your gift,\ntheir beauty, your life.\n\nH.D. from \"Cities\" (Sea Gardens)\n\n---\n\nWho knows the curious mystery of the eyesight? The other senses corroborate themselves, but this is removed from any proof but its own and foreruns the identities of the spiritual world. A single glance of it mocks all the investigations of man and all the instruments and books of the earth and all reasoning.\n\nThe great poet forms the consistence of what is to be from what has been and is. He drags the dead out of their coffins and stands them again on their feet. . . . he says to the past, Rise and walk before me that I may realize you. He learns the lesson. . . . he places himself where the future becomes present.\n\nWalt Whitman--from Preface to Leaves of Grass\n\n---\n\nWe will begin by examining the literature of Puritan New England. During the 17th century, women, figured as converts, heretics, captives, goodwives, and witches; indeed Puritan women and young girls were simultaneously represented as embodiments of exemplary virtue and deplorable deviance. We will explore a variety of genres--conversion narratives, captivity narratives, heresiographies, trial transcripts, diaries. \n\nDuring the second half of the semester we will concentrate on the powerful subliminal influence these issues and texts exert on certain 19th century American works. Concentration will be on primary texts but I want to enter our discussions of Hawthorne, Dickinson, and James via two books: Jonathan Crary’s Techniques of the Observer: On Vision and Modernity in the Nineteenth Century, and Sexuality and Space, edited by Beatriz Colomina.\n\nRequired Texts:\n\nTwo Packets containing much of the reading. The first one available the first day of class checks to be paid to the UB Foundation. David Hall ed., The Antinomian Controversy 1636-38. Jonathan Crary, Techniques of the Observer: On Vision and Modernity in the Ninteenth Century. Beatriz Colomina, ed., Sexuality and Space, Nathaniel Hawthorne, \"Young Goodman Brown,\" \"The Gentle Boy,\" \"Alice Doane’s Appeal,\" \"Rappaccini’s Daughter.\" The Marble Faun, Henry James, \"The Ghostly Rental,\" \"Maud-Evelyn,\" \"The Turn of the Screw,\" What Maisie Knew, The Golden Bowl.\n\nThere will be a group of recommended but not required texts on reserve in the library.

Panelists Khaled Fahmy (American University in Cairo), Mona El Ghobashy (independent scholar), and Robyn Creswell (Yale University and poetry editor at The Paris Review) gathered to consider the role of the Egyptian intellectual after President Mohammed Morsi’s dramatic fall and the subsequent political turmoil in Egypt and beyond. \n\nThis discussion comes after the May release of the novel Stealth by Sonallah Ibrahim, published by New Directions. Ibrahim, once a fierce dissident admired for his staunch opposition to state corruption (Bidoun has described Ibrahim as \"a force of legend in Egypt\"), is now baffling his peers and admirers by backing Egypt’s current government. “The Authoritarian Turn,” moderated by Negar Azimi, considered why this might be the case.\n\nSpeaking to a focused crowd—a mix of students and professors of Middle Eastern studies, readers of translated literature, and the merely curious—Khaled Fahmy recounted his powerful confrontation with Khaled Fahmy, the academic who coincidentally shares his name, and who was appointed to be the Director of Archives, a state-held position that strictly regulates access to Egypt’s public records. Robyn Creswell, who translated That Smell, the book Sonallah Ibrahim wrote on cigarette paper in prison and smuggled out for publication, considered the changing role of fiction across Egypt’s recent past. And Mona El Ghobashy debated the intentions of the Muslim Brotherhood and celebrated the rise of the Egyptian people. \n\nThank you to Bidoun, our wonderful co-host, for putting together this important discussion. Thank you to panelists Khaled Fahmy, Robyn Creswell, and Mona El Ghobashy, and to moderator Negar Azimi. Special thanks to Anna Della Subin, New York University, and everyone in attendance.

I’ll arbitrarily limit myself to a few living poets who have both challenged and extended the legacy of Pound, Williams, and other authors New Directions was first to publish. Needless to say, I could make a similar list of novelists. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nRosmarie Waldrop – Curves to the Apple\n\nRosmarie Waldrop’s trilogy of prose poems takes the syntax of philosophy and makes it sing. These books are—among many other things—masterpieces of lyric piracy. I return to this book as often as I return to any other volume of poetry. For its sentences and the silences she makes you feel between them.\n\nMichael Palmer – Codes Appearing\n\nI’ll just say of this gathering of three incredible books: only a poet capable of writing as beautifully as Palmer can make poems that investigate the limits of poetry so powerfully.\n\nNathaniel Mackey – Splay Anthem\n\nMackey’s combination of erudition and musical ability makes his ongoing serial works at once epic and intimate. In his hands the smallest differences between sound and sense scale into book-length architectures. The controlled political rage in “Splay Anthem” stays with me particularly. \n\nSusan Howe – My Emily Dickinson\n\nI’m not really sure which of Howe’s important books to single out, so I’ll choose this one, as Howe’s brilliant, idiosyncratic essay is—like much of her work—a combination of fierce rigor and deep generosity. Howe unlocks.\n\n— Ben Lerner \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Itself Not So\n  \n  \n    The Authoritarian Turn: On The State of the Egyptian Intelligentsia \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Though she was doing well where the pavement was smooth, where it buckled, she often got stuck. Her training wheels having hoisted the back wheel off the ground, she pedaled fruitlessly and, once, fell down. How unlike this girl was from the one evoked in Forrest Gander’s “Lovegreen” from Core Samples from the World, “the girl open-mouthed / pumping her two-wheeler / across a meadow softly-furred / as a bumble bee, her plastic bag / pendent with hard apples / from one handlebar swaying.” The critical difference, of course: Gander’s girl has no training wheels.\n\n\t\n\tPhoto from Core Samples from the World\n\tPhoto by Raymond Meeks\n\n\tThis summer, if you’re biking without a good book in your backpack, you’re incurring a similar misfortune. Biking bookless is the practiced cyclist’s training wheels; you might be whizzing about corporally, but you’re in spiritual stasis. Fortunately, the bookshelves at New Directions are packed with remedies, reads to keep your back wheel rolling all summer long. Without further ado: books on bikes.\n\n\t\n\n\tFirst up is a short story by Guy Davenport entitled “The Richard Nixon Freishütz Rag.” In a spectacularly knotted nine pages, Richard Nixon tours China, and an amorous couple swoons in a summer field. But it’s the middle passage that’s the real gear crank of the tale. Here, Davenport transports us to Renaissance Italy, where Leonardo Da Vinci is about to complete his new invention: the “two-wheeled balancing machine.” Though Leonardo is at first enthusiastic about his creation, picturing boys soaring “like the wind, like Ezekiel’s angel, like the horses of Ancona,” he soon lapses into melancholy as he considers the final component. What chance is there for progress and liberty when even the bicycle—at last releasing the human form from the terrible burden of being two-legged and upright—requires a chain?\n\n\t\n\n\tWhile Leonardo sees a limitation in the fact that a bike needs a chain, Raymond Queneau, co-founder of Oulipo—a collective of authors and mathematicians dedicated to exploring constrained writing—might more likely find potential. Like a bicycle, many of Queneau’s works also require chains—chains of his own devising—constraints  capable of delivering a person (writer/reader/rider) somewhere new and unexpected. It’s fitting that his final novel, The Flight of Icarus features a protagonist obsessed with mechanical locomotion. Icarus is a character that has escaped from the first pages of a poorly developed manuscript. (“How extremely Pirandellian,” one character comments.) Though he seems to enjoy what absinthe and sex fin-de-siècle Paris has to offer, Icarus finds complete satisfaction only in the pursuit of speed, a penchant he discovers during his first bike ride:\n\t    I feel I’m becoming a poet\n\t    Astride my bike—watch me go it!\n\n\t\n\tPhilippe Noiret (left) as Pablo Neruda in Il Postino\n\n\tQueneau’s Icarus isn’t the only poet to sing the praises of the most popular vehicle in the world. Pablo Neruda takes the same muse for a spin in his “Ode to Bicycles.” Describing passing cyclists as “the only / insects / in / that dry / moment of summer / silent / swift / translucent / they / barely stirred / the air,” Neruda evokes the envy all pedestrians must feel as we race gracefully past them. Later, finding a bicycle at rest, the poet ponders its lifelessness: “only moving / does it have a soul.” And how like our bicycles we cyclists are: only with sufficient soul (supplied by good books) can we actually move.\n\n\t\n\n\tBut however awful it must be to be a cyclist prevented from cycling, it must be much worse to be a storage shed. Such is the unenviable fate of the protagonist of Victor Pelevin’s story “The Life and Adventures of Shed Number XII” from his collection 4 By Pelevin. Here, the eponymous structure eludes his dread of becoming a pickling shed by dreaming he is one of the bicycles stored inside him. When his worst nightmare becomes a reality and the bikes are replaced by casks of sauerkraut, our hero loses all sense of self. Only the incidental approach of a passing cyclist, ringing his bell, restores the shed to his true identity: “It was enough—Number XII remembered: A bicycle. A highway. A sunset. A bridge over a river.”\n\n\t\n\tHenry Miller\n\n\tIf the self is only discovered in relation to a bicycle, it only makes sense that Henry Miller, that ardent admirer of self, highly prized his ride. In “Paris and Its Suburbs” from The Henry Miller Reader, Miller reflects on his time in France, mostly by reveling in his memories of cycling through it: “...this still mirror bearing the clouds moving transversally I, a complete corporate entity, a universe bringing countless centuries to a conclusion, I and this that passes beneath me and this that floats above me and all that surges through me, I and this, I and that joined up in one continuous movement, this Seine and every Seine that is spanned by a bridge is the miracle of a man crossing it on a bicycle.” Who could help but be swept along in Miller’s grandiose, track-bike lyricism?\n\n\t\n\tAlfred Jarry\n\n\tBut it’s Alfred Jarry, author of the infamous Ubu plays and inventor of ‘pataphysics, who most effectively weds the holy spirit of the reader with the body of the rider. Jarry so adored his velo that he christened it ce qui roule—that which rolls—and wore his cycling outfit at all times. His nearly religious admiration finds no more perfect expression than the short story “The Crucifiction Considered as an Uphill Bike Race.” As the title suggests, Jarry’s retelling revises the Scriptures, insisting that Christ wasn’t actually crucified—this two-thousand-year-old misunderstanding, Jarry explains, arises from the fact that biblical-era bicycles looked a lot like crosses. Oh, and Jesus rode his bike “lying flat on his back in order to reduce his air resistance.” Perhaps we should not be surprised that the Son of God was a prodigious cyclist; more surprising is the fact that he fell. And so perhaps the fate of the little girl I saw in the park is inevitably also our own. But when it’s our time to tip over, let it be at the last hairpin turn in the Golgotha racing track, and not stuck in some rut in McGolrick Park. \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     ND Nightstand: Lawrence Ferlinghetti\n  \n  \n    Itself Not So \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

His most recent translation is Sonallah Ibrahim’s Stealth, which was published by New Directions in June. I reached out to Hosam to ask how he came to translate Ibrahim’s great Cairo novel, the nuances of the process, and his forthcoming projects.\n\n\t* * * \n\n\tNEW DIRECTIONS: You’ve been friends with Sonallah Ibrahim for around twenty years, and yet this is your first translation of his work. How did you two become friends and what prompted you to translate Stealth?\n\t\n\tHOSAM ABOUL-ELA:I lived in Cairo for three years in the mid 1990s editing literary translations. I met many important fiction writers in the city, in most cases through a friend of a friend. Sonallah was no exception. We were introduced at a small dinner hosted by my neighbors, an ex-pat French/Moroccan couple, that was attended by Sonallah, his wife Laila, and a few other friends and writers. At one point our host looked over from the head of the table to say, \"One day, Hosam, perhaps you will translate a novel by Sonallah.\" Back then I felt intimidated and I think the comment made us both a little uncomfortable, but that moment came to mind years later when we agreed to the translation of Stealth.\n\t   By then my academic work had largely taken over my life, and it was difficult to keep up with new Egyptian writing. But reading Stealth was a different experience—I was immediately drawn to its portrayal of late 1940s Cairo. By the time I finished it, I knew that I had to translate it. Social life in Egypt has been so troubled that an almost pathological nostalgia haunts everyone.  While the novel critiques the present, it also dismantles that sentiment for the colonial era by revealing some of the sorrow of everyday life within it.\n\n\tND: Stealth came out a few years before the Egyptian Revolution and your translation first came out in 2010. What was Cairo like during that time? What about a book concerning 1950s Cairo felt relevant to the events that were occurring at that time? Did you feel a revolution coming?\n\n\tHA:The incidents building up to the revolt had been occurring since the early 1990s, when human rights organizations began to take shape and independent publishing reappeared in Egypt for the first time in 50 years. Sonallah was active in a movement calling for the resignation of Hosni Mubarak.Things like this undermined the power of the authoritarian state. The revolution itself began to crystalize in 2008, when on April 6 of that year, a general labor strike brought a number of cities to a halt. I was blogging at the time for Words Without Borders who wanted me to write about the literary scene in Egypt. Feeling compelled to say something about the mood in the streets, I managed to craft a post that described Egyptian writers as oppressed workers.\n\t    All of this brought to mind the background and atmosphere of Stealth—an era just before King Farouk was deposed by the revolution that brought Gamal Abdel Nasser to power. The loud complaints of the men sitting outside the grocery store, the political and sexual scandals filling up the newspapers, the state’s inability to cover people’s pensions or provide basic services, and the way everyone in the streets and alleys and apartment blocks angles and hustles to make ends meet. It felt like an eerie distant mirror.\n\n\t\n\n\tSonallah Ibrahim \n\n\tND: Could you talk a bit about the nuances and research that went into your translation. Ibrahim uses a lot of consumer products and media from that time period, and he’s meticulous about detail. What was the process like? How closely did you work with him?\n\n\tHA: Oh my, you have hit the nail on the head. The experience of reading the novel in Arabic was so effortless and free, because the phrases and sentences are all so direct. It wasn’t until I started translating Stealth that I began to see how meticulously the references to a bygone era of Cairo laid the foundation for the novel. So the actual process was pretty bizarre: translate three pages in a matter of minutes, then sweat over a paragraph for an hour. Thank goodness for the internet, but even that wasn’t always helpful. The French translation, Le petit voyeur, had already appeared and was an invaluable resource. The translator Richard Jacquemond is a friend and he explained how Sonallah wanted to ensure that every detail was properly accounted for. One anecdote told to me was how Sonallah convinced Richard that the hula hoop was already popular in Egypt before it made its way westward. Not wanting to be inaccurate or assuming, I thought the best course of action was to show Sonallah a draft of my translation.\n\t    My manuscript was returned with his comments lining the margins of every page. I have never worked with such a scrupulous author, but Sonallah’s involvement sharpened my translation. At times, for instance, I had reached for colloquialisms that he found either confusing or counterproductive. This actually allowed me to notice certain details—only on my last revision, for instance, did I pick up on the incredible ubiquity of references to King Farouk.  So I made some alterations to reflect this discovery, changing something like \"Heads or tails?\" in the coin toss scene back to a more literal \"King or writing?\" Eventually our exchange encouraged me to be more formal, which fit with the simplicity of the Arabic and its colonial era atmosphere. \n\n\t\n\n\tND: In 2003, Ibrahim famously refuted a prize that the state attempted to award him. Is he still as politically engaged and outspoken as he used to be? Do you know if he’s working on anything new inspired by the revolution?\n\n\tHA: Yes, Sonallah has been active—he attended demonstrations during the January 25th revolution and continued to be active afterwards, even helping to organize a sit-in to protest ex-President Morsi’s attempts to Islamize the Culture Ministry. He’s given interviews and made statements that have in no way shied from controversy. On the other hand, his writing has its own set of priorities and principles that seem almost unshakeable. That’s his attention to craft that I’ve been emphasizing.\n\t    I last saw Sonallah when I visited Egypt in January 2013. He asked me about a novel manuscript I was finishing and offered this advice: \"Avoid politics and keep it short.\" I was shocked at first that a writer so politically engaged would tell me this, but on reflection it made more sense. Sonallah was then working on a a novel based on his experiences in Germany in the late 60s. It seemed an odd time for an Egyptian to write about Berlin, but he simply said, “that’s what I want to do.\" I suspect that it’s his aesthetic principles that have allowed him to be innovative as a fiction writer in the wild environment that has always swirled around him. Many other writers and artists in the region are working references to current events into their work these days, but [Sonallah] writes about whatever he wants.\n\n\tND: What other novels have you translated? What are you currently working on?\n\n\tHA: Stealth is my third translation of a novel by a living Egyptian writer. The other two were Voices by Soleiman Fayyad and Distant Train by Ibrahim Abdel Meguid.\n\n\t\n\n\tAround the time I finished Stealth, Richard Jacquemond suggested that I translate Warda, a sprawling novel that Sonallah published in 2000. \"It’s rich,\" he told me. The title character is a woman who joins the Marxist separatists that fought in the Dhofar region of southern Oman during the late 1960s. Sonallah pairs this ambitious narrative with archival documents that one can’t find mentioned even in history books. The novel does not make compromises for its reader, which doesn’t make translating easy!\n\t     My academic work continues apace, and the novel I mentioned, The Observers, is now drafted and being circulated by my agent. It is set in Egypt in the 1990s against a backdrop of the militarization of daily life, during a dirty war the government waged against the armed Islamist resistance. It hasn’t come out yet, but it has already had an interesting afterlife. Egypt’s chief executive has changed three times since I started working on the last part of the first draft. Every few months, it seems to me that the material swings back between the poles of \"less relevant\" and \"eerily prescient.\" \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     The World Cup of Literature\n  \n  \n    ND Nightstand: Lawrence Ferlinghetti \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Not that I didn’t enjoy the rush, or the half-polarizing, half-globalizing spirit of tournament, but all that patriotism is exhausting, especially for someone whose experience with the sport is limited to having played a lot of Backyard Soccer on a candy-colored iMac. (And, as a Canadian, not being able to root for my country just made it worse.)\n\t\n\tThis time around, though, for me the World Cup wasn’t really about soccer. Instead, I found myself immersed in the strange world of literary awards. The World Cup of Literature (WCL), the first of its kind, was conceived as an amusing way to raise awareness for international fiction. We had 32 books for 32 countries, all competing for the top spot in a no-holds-barred, knockout tournament. The idea was to showcase young books (published post-2000) that would make strong representatives of their countries; we aimed especially to include books that otherwise might not reach a broader audience. How many English speakers read contemporary novels from Uruguay? Cameroon? Greece? Few organizations even publish literature from these regions. When Penguin, for instance, announced that it was holding a \"Penguin Cup\" this year, it only included 16 countries, bringing heavyweights with loose ties to other countries—Borges played for Uruguay. It was a pretty grim state of affairs.\n\t\n\tI got involved in the WCL when Chad Post of Open Letter Books announced the competition on the website Three Percent. As a bit of a lark, I responded to his call for \"illustrious judges.” I knew as little about judging literary competitions as I did about soccer. As an aspiring translator, however, I figured I had a vested interest in the project, so I threw my name in. I somehow finagled a spot on the panel, and the games began. There were 26 of us, a motley crew of publishing professionals, critics, translators, and readers, with Chad and New Directions’s own Tom Roberge acting as administrators.\n\n\tFirst, we winnowed down our options for each country. Some were trickier than others; there was no end to the UK and US contender pool, while trying to find translated work from Costa Rica and Ecuador proved daunting. Then Chad and Tom made the final selections which often followed a particular logic. The Pale King went up for the US because it’s \"unfinished—like the team!\" And despite being raised and identifying solely as El Salvadoran, being born in Honduras was enough to qualify Horacio Castellanos Moya to represent their team. Yet the initial bracket, in my opinion, turned out beautifully, mixing serious, literary masterpieces with rollicking, irreverent romps. We included household names, like Murakami, but also some a little less known such as Serbian writer Dubravka Ugresic whose strange little novel Baba Yaga Laid an Egg is a fantastical and lovely exploration of folklore, womanhood, and old age.\n\t\n\tEach match in the first two rounds was decided by a single, randomly assigned judge, who wrote up a commentary and assigned a final score to the books. Some people took this literally, describing in detail each book’s offensive and defensive advantages, and how it scored; others wrote much more straightforward, classic reviews. We switched to group voting for the quarterfinals, semifinals, and championship. For example, I judged the first-round match-up between Honduras and Switzerland, then sat out the second round. I was one of five judges in the quarterfinals game between Bosnia & Herzegovina and Germany, and one of thirteen in Germany’s match against Chile in the semifinals. For the finals, all 26 of us weighed in.\n\n\tThe tournament was a delight, the matches light-hearted and entertaining. I got to read great books that might otherwise have slipped under my radar: New Directions’ paranoid and captivating Senselessness for Honduras, the enchanting How the Soldier Repairs the Gramophone for Bosnia & Herzegovina, the lovely and melancholic Austerlitz for Germany. There were some contenders, like the novel repping Switzerland, that for me just fell flat. And there where some notable upsets. When Gerald Murnane’s Barley Patch defeated Javier Marías’s great, sprawling masterpiece Your Face Tomorrow in the first round, a few of the judges nearly staged a revolt. Other favorites, such as Russia, England, and Colombia, also dropped out immediately, leaving space in the competition for some excellent dark horses.\n\t\n\tBy the semifinals, however, the results seemed dishearteningly predictable. In spite of our cut-off date, we’d managed to pick three great but deceased writers: Sebald’s Austerlitz vs. Bolaño’s By Night in Chile. The only underdog, Mexican writer Valeria Luiselli’s Faces in the Crowd was up against David Foster Wallace’sThe Pale King. Luiselli, an exceptionally talented (and very much alive) young woman did upset DFW 7-6, and suddenly our final match-up was Chile against Mexico, Bolaño against Luiselli. That a character in Faces in the Crowd, a translator and talent scout for Latin American literature, complains heartily about the fact that no one in the States wants to read anything besides Bolaño became an eerie and depressing prophecy. Of course Bolaño won: he’s a legend, a genius who continues to win every prize ever, despite having been dead for eleven years. I loved By Night in Chile; it’s one of my favorite books from New Directions (or anywhere else, for that matter). But it frustrated me to see Faces in a Crowd lose out to an established book and author.\n\t\n\tThere’s been some talk of doing a Women’s World Cup of Literature in 2015. But even more than getting more women into the competition, we need to get more dead authors out of it. It’s too easy to put them on a pedestal. When Germany went up against Bosnia & Herzegovina in the quarterfinals, some of the judges cracked jokes about how Austerlitz was going to steamroll Sasha Stanisic’ How the Soldier—because Sebald is \"one of the greats,\" and Stanišić is a 36-year-old first-timer. But Sebald merely squeaked by with a 4-3 victory. While Austerlitz, with its quiet, tragic beauty, is an established classic, Stanišić’s vibrant, magical novel, with its depiction of a child growing up as Yugoslavia falls apart, is pretty close to perfect. And unlike the deceased Sebald, the publicity would be better spent on the living Stanisic.\n\t\n\tMy only serious contention with the project it didn’t challenge its own biases. There are several factors at fault here—for one thing, authors in less book-oriented countries have fewer opportunities to find recognition in their own countries, let alone in the international community. This is a huge problem, and one that is not easily or quickly solved. But another, perhaps more realistic place to start is to work to address the current of the “Great Man” that runs through the literary world. The WCL was supposed to be about living literature, but it still managed to fall into the trap of glorifying great-books-by-dead-guys above all others. If we can reexamine what makes a book \"great\" or \"good\" or \"worthwhile,\" maybe we can look forward to seeing literary competitions that actually make some waves.\n\t\n\tThis small shortcoming aside, the first World Cup of Literature was a lot of fun and a great success, and I believe that it, and other endeavors like it, has the capacity to do a lot of good for world literature. Here’s to the Women’s WCL, and Canada 2015! \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Photos from The Driver's Seat Screening\n  \n  \n    Translator Spotlight: Hosam Aboul-Ela \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Originally released as Indentikit, the film stars Elizabeth Taylor and features Andy Warhol among its cast members.\n\n\tEn route to Rome, the erratic Lise, played by Taylor, travels to meet her illusory boyfriend. The film was introduced by Eric Banks, director of NYU’s New York Institute for the Humanities and a former senior editor of Artforum who relaunched Booksforum in 2003. In his introduction, he noted that the film could be, at moments, uncomfortable to watch. Yet in spite of this, the audience shared a few laughs in Taylor’s absurd portrayal of Lise, from her penchant for psychedelic prints to her eroticized drive toward death.\n\n\tAn intimate space, Light Industry housed a full audience to watch this oft-forgotten adaptation, whose scarcity is rumored to be due to Taylor’s later attempts to purchase all rights to and copies of the film. Just as Spark’s original novella was rediscovered and nominated for the 2010 “Lost Man Booker Prize” forty years after its first publication, last Tuesday’s event unearthed another \"lost work\" to be appreciated by Spark, Taylor, and Warhol fans alike.\n\n\tPhotographs by Stephanie Huang\n\n\t\n\n\tThe recent Muriel Spark re-prints and her essay collection The Informed Air\n\n\t\n\n\tMoviegoers in discussion\n\n\t\n\n\tEric Banks introduces the film\n\n\t\n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\tThe opening title\n\n\t\n\n\tThe audience\n\n\t\n\n\tSpark books and refreshments\n\n\t\n\n\tA Muriel Spark date\n\n\t\n\n\tThe audience at Light Industry\n\n\t\n\n\tThe audience\n\n\t\n\n\tThe evening’s last Modelo \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     STEALTH Mix: Awesome Tapes from Africa for ND\n  \n  \n    The World Cup of Literature \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

By taking in its sights, sounds, and smells, the boy creates a portraint of 1950s Cairo. In a previous post, we explored those sights with an animation by Nathaniel Whitcomb who created a motion collage from the mid-century Cairo photographs of Don Church. Now, we present to you a mix of popular 1950s Egytian music compiled by the acclaimed ethnomusicologist and DJ, Brian Shimkovitz, proprietor of the legendary website and label, Awesome Tapes From Africa.\n\t    Awesome Tapes From Africa is exactly as its name implies. Shimkovitz has amassed over hundreds of cassette tapes from African musicians dating back to the 1970s (though his knowledge of music from that continent goes back even further), and has created a name for himself by making this music available worldwide. \n\t   We reached out to Shimkovitz to ask how he compiled this mix and to find out more about the Awesome Tapes From Africa project.\n\n\t* * * \n\n\tNew Directions: How did Awesome Tapes From Africa begin? How has it evolved in the past few years as interest in it grew?\n\t\n\tBrian Shimkovitz: I began Awesome Tapes From Africa as a blog through which to share music that didn’t have as much visibility outside the continent, expressing my fascination for subcultural musical movements using a very approachable format. For a long time the blog was a hobby and over the years it’s become a kind of record label and dj project. Music listeners have in general opened their ears to lots of sounds so there’s been enough of an audience to support official releases. Collaborating with artists to make their records available worldwide on LP and CD has been a rewarding result, and I am still having fun doing the blog.\n\n\tND: What kinds of music were Laila Murad and Ulm Kalthoum making? What are some other notable Egyptian musicians, from any period, that interest you?\n\n\tBS: Laila Murad and Uum Kalthoum were making popular music for film and radio focused on traditional poetics but using modern instrumentation (the big band and/or symphony orchestra). Murad is interesting because of her connection with the revolution—as a favored artist. And Klathoum of course because she is the most internationally famous of all Egyptian singers. Fareed al-Atrash is a favorite and he gets a mention in Stealth, and Coptic religious chants that came to mind following a brief reference to Coptic Christians in the book. The later music by Abdel Wahab is also of interest, along with Shadia. I don’t end up using all of this in the mix but it was in mind.\n\n\tND: How did reading Stealth inspire the Stealth mix? Could you tell us about putting this mix together? How did you discover and select the artists?\n\n\tBS: I felt like the child character’s sneaking around had this undulating soundtrack of slower and then more frenetic music accompanying it. I went through the book and picked out the musical, cinematic and literary references that had the most impact on the scenes in which they appeared.  Tracking down the songs took a while. I went for sound and movements that made sense with the sparse yet vivid color of Ibrahim’s prose.\n\n\tND: Your website features African music that goes back to the 1970s, presumably as far back as cassettes themselves. Why do cassettes of African music over other types of recording formats interest you? Where did you find the recordings of the artists on the mix? \n\n\tBS: When I first studied in West Africa I only had tapes to deal with, since it was 2002. Later as CDs and mp3s and bluetooth technology became more prevalent, the world of collecting music has become much more interesting. The simplicity of the website’s concept helped me get creative within limitations, and now it kind of keeps me focusing on music of a certain era.\n\t     For the mix I searched mostly on Arabic language video sites and YouTube, where you can pull the mp3s from the videos using a simple program. I had to do some translation/transliteration back and forth to find specific songs or artists or films. I never realized how rich the Egyptian film history is and how musical those movies are! There’s this website that contains tons of Egyptian film posters and links to watch them.\n\t    I have always loved cassettes, and when I used to live in New York and could find Egyptian tapes from the late 70s and early 80s in South Brooklyn, which was a lot of fun. I am constantly finding more music on these mass produced pieces of art and I think focusing just on tapes will give me way too much to listen to for a long time.\n\n\tND: What are some of the more interesting projects you have or working on with Awesome Tapes? And if I’m not mistaken, you’ve recently made Awesome Tapes into a label. How has that been going? What have you released?\n\n\tBS: Recently I got to help Penny Penny—a singer from South Africa—and his large group over to the Sydney Opera House for a festival. Actually locating the families of the musicians I admire, sometimes after years of searching, has been taking up a lot of my energy lately, which has been incredible.\n\t     Awesome Tapes From Africa has become a way to expand the market for Africa music and the company itself splits profits 50/50 with the artists. We have been able to release several records in the past couple years and hope to continue tracking down the musicians and making deals to get them shows around the world.\n\n\t* * *\n\n\tStealth by Sonallah Ibrahim is now available from New Directions. \n\n\t \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Pneumatic Antiphonal: An Interview with Sylvia Legris\n  \n  \n    Photos from The Driver's Seat Screening \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Cover design by Office of Paul Sahre\n\n\tThe poems of Pneumatic Antiphonal are tricky to sight-read. On one hand, their music is an invitation to abandon. Just mouth the words and trust her. Fall in and sing. Legris is a master of rhythm and closure. On the other hand, the language of these poems is an invitation to stop the music. In order to follow the word play, it’s necessary to make hard pause and close study. Get a drink and a good dictionary. Or a full bottle and the OED. \n\t    Legris anatomizes song—birdsong, but also, always, the aspiring song of the poet. Is this an impossible task? Bones, soft tissue, and even spit can be pinpointed, but what about breath? motile air? pneuma or spirit? What about this:\n\n\t            Jizz of airborne lungs: venturi tube trachea; cul-de-sac lift / drag\n\t            ratio; emphysematic airflow.\n\t                                                               – from “Lore: 7 (aspect ratio)”\n\n\tThe closer we get to anything in Legris’s anatomy, the more biting and mysterious it turns. True to life. \n\n\tThis interview took place over two spring months. Emails flew back and forth between Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, where Legris lives and writes, and West Harlem.  – Jesse Ruddock\n\n\t*\n\n\tJESSE RUDDOCK: On the internet, your biography is nicely spare. But I would love to know a little more, particularly since your poetry doesn’t inhabit a landscape, not one with fixed markers. As I read, I often wonder where you’re from.\n\n\tSYLVIA LEGRIS: I grew up in Winnipeg and have lived in Saskatoon for about 20 years (shockingly!) I’d intended to stay here for no longer than a year, but became stuck—for chronic lack of money, lack of confidence, superstition that if I relocated I wouldn’t be able to write. And then you acquire friends and a routine, and it’s a pain to get a new doctor and dentist, all that stuff. Those times when I have had enough money to seriously consider moving, I’ve just wanted to stay put and write. (My rate of production is slow enough at the best of times...if my work is going well, I don’t want to jinx it with the quite possibly deluded notion that it will go even better elsewhere.)\n\t    And it’s true, my poetry doesn’t inhabit a landscape, certainly not a geographic one. There are a number of preconceptions and assumptions associated with being a prairie or Saskatchewan writer: that you write about landscape if not a rural landscape, the \"big sky,\" the vast open prairie; that writing from here largely adheres to a tradition of prairie realism; that poetry from this part of the world tends to be lyrical, anecdotal, regional, insular versus outward-looking, more about self-expression than ideas and language.\n\t    I wasn’t aware of any of these preconceptions when I moved here, so I didn’t consciously set out to resist this or any other type of writing—it’s simply not a part of my DNA, psychic or otherwise. Even in the urban centers of Saskatchewan, the presence, the pervasiveness of agriculture and farming, of a rural topography is inescapable. Growing up in Winnipeg, however, I had no sense that there was something dubbed \"The Prairies\"; my experience and sensibility, like the books and visual art and movies I was exposed to, were decidedly urban, or at least discovered within an urban context. I have to admit, I feel uneasy and unsettlingly exposed in wide-open spaces, like I’m a moving target or a lightning rod.\n\n\tJR: Have you seen Guy Maddin’s film My Winnipeg? Is Winnipeg a mystic city for you too?\n\n\tSL: I have seen My Winnipeg, and I’m a big Guy Maddin fan. I don’t think I really appreciated Winnipeg until I had some distance from it. When I go back there as a visitor, it does seem curiously magical. I’ve flirted numerous times with the idea of moving back there—I still feel very much that I’m a Winnipegger. I hold steadfastly loyal to certain Winnipeg brands: Old Dutch potato chips, Nutty Club jujubes. Winnipeg is a city cut through with a brilliant and goofy self-deprecating humor. Writers and artists there (and from there) tend to take their work seriously, but not themselves. Down with posturing! There’s a lack of preciousness and pretention there that intermingles with an appreciation for innovation and ideas. And interaction among the various artistic disciplines appears to happen readily in Winnipeg—writers working with artists, artists with composers, etc.\n\n\tJR: I also wonder where you’re from in terms of books. Did you read a lot as a kid?\n\n\tSL: All I did as a kid was read. Haphazardly, with little guidance or interference. When I read or hear interviews with writers speaking of books from their childhood that influenced them, it always sounds like Lewis Carroll or Rudyard Kipling rose from the grave and sprinkled them with magic fairy dust: Henceforth you will be named Writer. I’ve pondered the idea of writing an essay titled \"Inappropriate Books My Mother Foisted on Me.\" In grade three I was presented with my very own copies of R.D. Laing’s The Divided Self and Theodore Isaac Rubin’s Lisa and David. The only thing these instilled in me was a mistrust of adults proffering gifts and advice. As an adolescent, though, I had a steady diet of Doris Lessing, Thomas Hardy, and D.H. Lawrence, with the odd shot of William Peter Blatty and Harold Robbins. What a recipe!\n\n\tJR: When you write, is it always at the same table? And do you have resources at hand—notebooks, other books, stuff?\n\n\tSL: I write on a circa 1940s wood kitchen table that I bought at a yard sale. I write on a MacBook, facing a wall. I am completely ergonomically incorrect and spend way too much time fidgeting and trying to get comfortable. I like to eat Smarties or M&Ms when I’m writing—they are portion-controlled, uniform, and more colorful than Reese’s pieces. I make lots of notes in little notebooks (I like the grid-lined paper so I can write in every direction). I often make notes while riding the bus; depending on how bad the potholes are on a given bus-route, my handwriting in such notes ranges from mild to moderate Parkinsonian to cardiac arrest in progress. I consult any number of field guides on various subjects as well as books about anatomy. I sometimes consult science books aimed at 9-12 year olds because they explain complex concepts at a level that even I can more or less understand. I spend a lot of time staring at the pictures hoping that some crucial yet previously undiscovered hatch will pop open in my brain.\n\n\t\n\n\tOn the windowsill next to Legris’s writing table\n\n\tJR: What’s good about writing in every direction on a piece of paper?\n\n\tSL: What’s not good about it?  Maybe it’s related to my love-hate relationship with crossword puzzles. Or Scrabble. When I’m waiting for the bus or if I’m waiting in line somewhere my brain defaults to anagram-mode. It’s like counting how many cars of a particular make or color you pass on a road trip. I have an innate assembly line mentality (I’d love to be the person who eyeballs the icing-thickness in the Oreos as they are conveyed to their final destination). I have the makings of a super-excellent continuity person.\n\n\tJR: The three drawings in Pneumatic Antiphonal are placed at conspicuous intervals. There is one on the back of the half title, one dead-center, and one on the closing page. Are they thresholds of some kind?\n\n\tSL: The designer ultimately determined the placement of the drawings—it was mainly contingent on there being enough space given the number of pages, though it makes thematic sense to have the quartet of furculae precede the wishbone poem. (I love the word \"merrythought.\" It’s so tragically optimistic, a kiss you blow someone just before they blow all their savings at the racetrack.)\n\t    But the fact is, I can’t draw. I’d like to be able to draw. I have a keen visual and spatial imagination and memory and I often get ideas for drawings, but I don’t have the technical skills to execute them in any half-decent way. What you call drawings fall somewhere between doodling and fooling around, letting my mind and hand wander, a blur of fixated-ness and daydreaming.\n\n\tJR: Moving from image to poem, what carries over? \n\n\tSL: These little drawings are less thresholds or punctuations between individual poems than they are rest stops between idea, word, and page. If I’m stuck on a poem, there’s something about the physical, intuitive, chicken-pecking movement of a drawing pen on paper that draws me, if you will, towards if not a solution to a problem then at least nearer to where I think I should go. If I draw something that turns out not bad, I’m pleased. But the pleasure is more akin to doing a really thorough vacuuming of a cat-hairy carpet than it is to writing a poem in which I think I’ve nailed what I was attempting to do.\n\n\tJR: I love the cover. The red pixels are deceptively simple, pretty and menacing. They look discrete at first glance but actually bleed into each other, just a little, and bleed all the way down the book’s spine. The cover is also a good digital joke. On-screen, its image looks like a mis-saved file that is too low-res.\n\n\tSL: That’s funny! I love the cover of Pneumatic Antiphonal, but to me it seems more mechanical than digital. There was an earlier cover mock-up that featured some sort of pneumatic valve—a hunk of metal extracted from a machine or engine; my take of the current cover is clearly influenced by this other image. What you identify as being pixels look to me like square bolt- or valve-heads...What do I know! What I do know is that when I look at the cover I always think of Charlie Chaplin in that famous scene from Modern Times when, hands locked in perpetual bolt-tightening reflex, he scurries after a shrieking woman on the street trying to tighten the buttons on her ass!\n\n\t\n\n\tThe alternative pamphlet cover. Design by Office of Paul Sahre\n\n\tJR: I also think the cover is funny because—among the many languages in your poetry—I can’t find digital language. There’s no computer or cell phone talk.\n\n\tSL: Yes, I guess my writing is devoid of digital language. I’ve never thought about including or excluding such language—I’ve just never thought about it. My poetry tends to focus on anatomy in one way or another; so far, incorporating digital language or technology wouldn’t have made sense. Maybe at some point I’ll branch out into writing about bionics and other prosthetics, cochlear implants and the like.\n\n\tJR: There is so much music here, and not only in the acoustics of your verse, but also as one of your main subjects: the anatomy of birdsong. Do these poems need to be read aloud?\n\n\tSL: I don’t think they have to be read aloud, but I do take great pains to make sure that they work really well when they are read out loud (some attempts more successful than others). I am a stickler when it comes to line-breaks and spacing; I aim for the text on the page to approximate as closely as possible how it should be read or heard out loud, sort of an aural map or guide for the reader. When I hear poets read their work, my own ear is alarmingly accurate in discerning the length, the breaks of their lines based on how they’re reading them...however, what I often hear is a crash of words collapsing into some variation of prose and then I’ll subsequently see the same work on the page with line-breaks. My feeling is that the line-breaks are there for a reason; if you’re not going to observe your own line-breaks, why have them? Then again I read my prose poems out loud almost as though they do have line-breaks, but the pacing there is more internal, meted out by a combination of punctuation and my tongue’s facility not to trip over such phrases as \"Countersong sung pneumomnemonically.\" You should hear me read these poems doing my Genuine Nerd Toby Radloff impression!\n\n\tJR: I think this book contains virtuosic examples of sprung rhythm. “Lore: 14 (mirror call)” channels Hopkins with its slew of unabashed stresses and its last words: “call and call / and call and call…” You and Hopkins also turn to birds. This makes sense for sprung rhythm, with language constantly picking up and trying to take flight off the page. And the closing note of your poem “Esophageal Hiatus” is “dappled.” The following lines read to me like they could be an acknowledgement of influence, a sweet nod to Hopkins’s famous “Pied Beauty”:\n\n\t             [...] From neck to diaphragm the\n\t             phrenic nerve is a Strat string waiting to sing. The stratosphere\n\t\n\t             utter color: ruby-gulleted, rose-torsoed, yellow covert sun with\n\t             white scapulars, dappled.\n\n\tSo did you learn from Hopkins, study him hard?\n\n\tSL: Okay, this is where I have a close encounter of the unschooled kind. I’ve actually read very little Hopkins, mainly in Norton-type anthologies. If you’d mentioned \"Pied Beauty\" to me out of context, I would have thought you were referring to a horse. Some golden oldies Hollywood star of the four-legged variety perhaps, maybe a Ronald Reagan or Elizabeth Taylor sidekick-slash-equine love interest. However, when it comes right down to it, who knows if even the bit of Hopkins I have read has seeped into my work on some level. No doubt I’ve been influenced by the works of other writers who may themselves have been overtly influenced by Hopkins. I’ve certainly read a lot of Geoffrey Hill.\n\n\tJR: You have a lot of rhythm. Where else did you pick it up?\n\n\tSL: Like a lot of people I studied music for a while when I was a kid but didn’t keep it up (I very likely would have if not for a lack of money and parental prodding/encouragement). Despite this, I think I am quite musical—I have a good ear, not too bad a voice, though I’m extremely self-conscious; I think I’ve channelled any musical inclinations into my poetry. My own musical tastes are all over the place, Joy Division to Bach to Colin Stetson to Alt-J to Antoine Forqueray. I keep returning to any recordings featuring Vittorio Ghielmi who is a viola da gamba virtuoso.\n\n\tJR: The title of the pamphlet suggests the poems could be prayers—a calling out or singing by the spirit under pressure. Is it so? Is the anatomizing of particulars in these poems a kind of spiritual exercise?\n\n\tSL: The first poems I wrote for Pneumatic Antiphonal were a couple of the very short-lined poems. To me these poems are like complex, full-bodied organisms that have been stripped down to these skeletal or scaffold-like structures. These poems began with a lot of text and information and notes. I was curious to see how much of that information I could pare away without the poems completely falling apart. Many of the lines after all contain only a single word. I didn’t want them to seem like flabby poems that had been arbitrarily broken down into short lines. I wanted each word to be instilled with as much semantic and morphological resonance as possible, for all the stuff that was removed to be echoing in the background, hovering around the ribs of each poem. I spend a lot of time researching each key word, looking at its etymology, both its common and more specialized meaning, how it might have migrated from one area of science to another, from being colloquial to outmoded, or resurrected from an archaic usage into a more contemporary one. I’m always fascinated and excited by the overlaps of various branches of language, in this case the correspondences between medical and ornithological terminology. In the context of these poems, the word pneumatic itself carries so many apt associations: whether in a mechanical sense, e.g., pneumatic drills; musically—think pipe organs; the hollow pneumatic bones of birds; and of course from the Greek pneuma/pnuematikos for breath, spirit, lungs, the stuff of both respiration and song.\n\n\tJR: Lore is the first word we hit in the opening poem’s title, “Lore: 1 (premise).” And there are fourteen Lore poems neatly scattered throughout the book. The OED defines lore as a lesson or a bit of doctrine. Research also proved that lore is the place between the eyes and nostrils of a bird or reptile. Is lore an organizing principle here—is that right?\n\n\tSL: The Lore poems feel like the more blocky structures that are somewhat obscured by the scaffolding. The call and response, the antiphonal arrangement of this collection is in part between the short-lined poems and the prose poems. But there’s also, I hope, a back and forth between the hyper-enunciated distilled language of the skeletal poems and the speciously authoritative comparatively wordy Lore poems. Almost a struggle for breath—a pressure or duress to get what few words there are utterly precise—versus a longwindedness. And then of course there’s the antiphonal singing that goes on among many species of birds. So, yes, I’d say that the Lore poems and the short-lined poems are both organizing principles.\n\n\tJR: Your last book, Nerve Squall, contains a haze of nightmarish birds. Among other slurs, they are “demon-faced” and “migrainous.” Generally speaking, they are a major fucking problem: “HARRASSING HARRASSING HARRASSING.” But in Pneumatic Antiphonal, birds are different. Now they are a source of aesthetic wonder, prized objects of study. What torqued the symbol?\n\n\tSL: After Nerve Squall I really resisted, struggled with, the idea of including birds in any of my writing again. I’d been thinking about these poems prior to Nerve Squall being shortlisted for the Griffin, and it was less an issue then because that book, like many poetry collections, had pretty much fallen off the map—i.e., few people would have known there were birds in Nerve Squall because few people had any knowledge it existed. I’d had someone once tell me that I’m a \"one-trick pony\" because my work is often about the human body. With the presence of birds in two collections, I’d run the risk of being labelled a two-trick pony, which still makes for a pony with a pretty limited repertoire! The poems I wrote while avoiding writing the poems that would become Pneumatic Antiphonal felt alien, like someone else had written them, and in the midst of working on them I kept being pulled to (and continued to resist) these new bird poems. Finally I thought Fuck it, I’m going to write what I want to write.\n\t   These new birds came to me unexpectedly, yes, as you suggest, as a major fucking problem as birds often are. I’d been having some respiratory stuff going on, and it felt like a number of birds had taken up residence in my lungs—a relentless cooing and fussing and fluttering and banging around. I’d spent months doing research on the respiratory system, even watching videos of surgical procedures and lungs being intubated. I was so immersed in and preoccupied with all this information that I wasn’t so sure I actually wanted...well, I guess it had to go somewhere...fly the coop or leave the nest or...\n\t    I’ll confess that while I do like birds, they can often also creep me out.\n\n\tJR: You’ve made a very cool discovery, that songbirds have “An onomatopoeic anatomy.” You demonstrate and spell it out for us in the first stanza of “Lore: 2 (decoy)”:\n\n\t                    1\n\t             Historiated hiss alarms and Zeet! whistles. The first note inter-\n\t             woven with reed and rectrices. Intervertevibrato. Interstitial\n\t             pishing. An onomatopoeic anatomy.\n\n\tCan you tell the story of making this discovery?\n\n\tSL: You’re right, it is cool. Asking where it came from is like asking which came first, the chicken or the egg? It’s all an enigma to me. It’s a riddle wrapped in an egg.\n\n\tJR: Through the whole text, you borrow only three phrases: one from Gray’s Anatomy and two from the poet Will Alexander. How did Alexander’s fragments—“a haphazard sparrow” and “debating oxygen as form”—slip into your poems? And why did they stick through revisions?\n\n\tSL: I feel such a pull towards Will Alexander’s work—his writing is unlike anyone else’s. I often don’t understand what he’s doing in any sort of logical or \"Yeah, I get this\" way, yet acoustically it makes total, inexplicable, sense to me. His poems are like complex compositions of music, mathematics, physics, and metaphysics. I have an almost visceral reaction to his writing, similar to how I feel when I listen to a Bach concerto, like my brain is full of sparks. Everything he writes seems unique yet feels like it’s exactly how it’s supposed to be. I’m surprised that his writing hasn’t gotten wider attention than it has. I first discovered his work about 15 or so years ago, via a few poems in an anthology (I’m pretty sure it was the one edited by Eliot Weinberger, American Poetry since 1950...it was a library copy so I don’t have it to consult). I was so struck by Alexander’s writing that I special-ordered several of his books (at that time, they seemed impossible to find in Canada).\n\n\tJR: And Gray’s Anatomy?\n\n\tSL: Well, Gray’s Anatomy is an ongoing resource for me (I have my own cheaply reproduced copy, but it’s cheap enough that I can tear pages out to take with me when I’m working elsewhere...is that bad to admit?) I think I look at the illustrations more than anything—by Henry Vandyke Carter, by the way, not Henry Gray.\n\n\tJR: Do you feel braced by the conversations you hold with other poets and artists in and outside of your work? Or is writing truly solitary?\n\n\tSL: The writing is out of necessity solitary, though I never feel alone when I’m in the midst of it. I have a few close friends who are poets whose work I am in awe of—they live in other provinces, though, so we email and have long phone conversations and get together when we can. These conversations are often a welcome reminder of why it’s important to do something as ridiculous as write poems (maybe we’re all deluded!) It’s a pretty strange way to spend your time when you think about it.\n\n\tJR: You described living in Saskatoon and shaping your life around writing. Reading through all your books, it seems obvious that writing is imperative. Are you always working on a new project?\n\n\tSL: Writing right now certainly feels vital—I’m really excited by the poems I’m currently working on. It’s awful even to imagine losing that sense of excitement about writing, losing the ability to surprise myself, to surpass (by my own measure) what I’ve previously done. I still think (I know) I can do better work, though: this is what keeps me doing it, curiosity about the next poem, all those yet to be figured out next poems.\n\n\tJR: In the poem “Marginal Notes” from your second book, Iridium Seeds (1998), you reference what must have been a surprising conversation with a writer friend. First, this friend accuses your poems of being too earnest. Then comes the provocation: \"where’s the irreverence?\" You conclude the poem by asking: \"[was that / irreverent?]\" Do you still think about this conversation when you’re writing? I think you might, since your poems are so intensely playful and definitely irreverent at turns.\n\n\tSL: I don’t think about this conversation, and haven’t looked at that poem in a long time. Why irreverence? As I mentioned previously, my mother had me reading R.D. Laing when I was nine. How do you come away from that not being irreverent? \n\n\t\n\n\tWindowsill detail\n\n\t* * *\n\n\tSylvia Legris was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba and now lives in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.

In the lower floor of McNally Jackson, the novelists Katie Kitamura, Sarah Gerard, and our own Mieke Chew joined the two editors Taylor Davis-Van Atta and Daniel Medin in celebrating the launch of the fourth issue with readings, discussions, and two performances by the acclaimed violinist Filip Pogády. This was the second of two launches—the first, held this past Friday at Bookcourt in Brooklyn, was a dual launch along with The Cahier Series No. 23 Clarice: The Visitor, a poetic meditation on Lispector by her translator, the poet Idra Novey. \n\t     This isn’t the first Music & Literature issue to prominently examine the life and work of an ND writer. Issue two highlighted László Krasznahorkai, Bela Tarr, and the artist Max Neumann. A number of the essays included were suggested by Krasznahorkai himself. A future issue may feature the poet Alejandra Pizarnik, whose pamphlet A Musical Hell we published last year. ND plans to bring out a full-length collection of her work in April.\n\t     Daniel and Taylor both have backgrounds in music and literature. The former attended conservatory for violin studies, and the latter toured as company with post-rock luminaries U.S. Maple and Melt Banana. These editors met through the great translation critic Scott Esposito. \n\t     I reached out Daniel and Taylor to discuss the formation of Music & Literature, its unique approach to compiling portfolios, and what kinds of artists are ideal for their magazine. Accompanying this interview are photos by Jesse Ruddock that perfectly capture the celebratory air of the evening. —Michael Barron\n\n\tMICHAEL BARRON: What prompted the inception of Music & Literature? Could you describe the process from idea to publication?\n\n\tDANIEL MEDIN: Roberto Bolaño described his dream reader as the sort of person who engages with the complete works of an author. There’s an impulse behind this project similar to the drive to read every word by a writer like Dickinson, Kafka or—to choose a more recent example—Bolaño. Among the greatest delights of assembling each issue is the nature of the labor required: total submersion in the cosmos of a superlative artist. To my knowledge, no other journal comes close to satisfying this thirst for depth and sustained attention. In a publishing climate where commercial “viability” determines content, there’s a genuine need for such unapologetic focus. Despite its own host of challenges, being a not-for-profit assures us greater freedom of inclusion than most other editors enjoy. Quality and relevance determine the content, not word count or precedent.\n\n\tTAYLOR DAVIS-VAN ATTA: And to plunge into the life’s work of Bolaño or Kafka—or Arvo Pärt, Max Neumann, Pina Bausch, Kaija Saariaho, Ingmar Bergman, among countless others—is a project without end. The works produced by these artists are inexhaustible, and deserve a class of accessible, smart, and enjoyable literature that meaningfully engages with them—and that provides the opportunity to discover what we haven’t encountered before. This is the base need we’re trying to address with the Music & Literature project.\n\t    In this sense, M&L began as an act of frustration, an impulse against a culture that’s too vast, diffuse, commercially-obsessed, and fleeting in its tastes to be taken seriously. In short, I wanted to publish the work that I myself wanted to read: work that spans disciplines and art forms, that pays no attention to national borders, that encourages contributions from a wide array of cultures and languages, and—above all—that aspires to the heights of the art it’s discussing.\n\t     M&L is an arts magazine, at once broadly defined and intensely focused. What has changed since its inception is our expansion into multiple venues; we now publish reviews and features online in complement to our print issues, and we’ve recently launched an ambitious events program that will take place year-round and around the world—with all of these activities concerted and aimed at serving a single mission.\n\n\t\n\n\tDaniel Medin, Sarah Gerard, and Katie Kitamura discuss Clarice Lispector\n\n\tMB: Your stated mission is to highlight the work of artists you feel are underrepresented. How do you define “underrepresented?”\n\n\tDM: Certainly one way to understand it is underrepresented in English. When I introduced the Cahiers Series to László Krasznahorkai in 2009, the only novels of his that had been translated were Melancholy of Resistance (1989) and War & War (1999). Throughout the nineties and oughts, Ammann (Switzerland) then Fischer (Germany) published these and other fascinating titles: seven in all. Not bad, given that twelve were available in Hungarian! But when only two of twelve books by one of the world’s greatest living writers are available for readers of English, well, that’s underrepresentation. Lack of translation’s a serious issue, which is why it plays a central role for our magazine, but the problem exceeds questions of language. At the moment we’re deep into a portfolio of Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho. If success can be measured by laudatory critical reception and repeated performances around the world, then her L’amour de loin (2000) must be among the most successful operas of the past fifteen years. Yet Saariaho remains largely unknown outside of specialized circles: a veritable schande, given the diversity and scale of her achievements.\n\n\tTDVA: Something similar can be said for each of our other featured artists, even for Arvo Pärt, who is the world’s most prolifically performed living composer and who features in our debut issue. When Arvo’s Fourth Symphony was debuted by the L.A. Philharmonic in early 2009, it received widespread attention from major newspapers and music journals across the country, yet few attempts were made by journalists and critics to place this new symphony in any sort of context, and fewer dared respond to the music itself. It was a missed opportunity not only for Pärt’s established audience and other fans of classical music, but for the anglophone culture at large. It’s one example of this missing—or at least anemic—class of informed and inquisitive literature on the arts.\n\t    I’m not convinced that universal critical praise actually helps connect artists with their potential audience: the critical culture is too untrustworthy and there too many other things competing for our attention. In the literary world, the works by writers whom I consider to be giants—Lispector, Krasznahorkai, Ugrešić—have not resonated out into the broader culture. There’s a small and, I suspect, shrinking pool of readers for these authors. Even if Krasznahorkai and Béla Tarr are more widely recognized by name than most, their art remains largely obscured. This can be said of all the artists we feature: Micheline Aharonian Marcom, Max Neumann, Vladimír Godár, Maya Homburger, et al., are known by very few, and their art resides in virtual anonymity.\n\n\tMB: The amount of material you guys compile is astounding. In Issue 4, there are nineteen pieces about and inspired by Clarice Lispector that range from letters, to reviews and essays, to even a full-color spread of some of Lispector’s paintings. Some are reprinted pieces, others new or newly translated. And she’s only one of four featured artists in an issue that spans almost 300 pages. What’s the process for selecting the kinds of work you would like to see featured about and by a particular artist or writer? What are some of the hurdles in collecting these pieces?\n\n\tTDVA: Part of my admiration for Clarice stems from her inclination to slight even her own philosophical or aesthetic flights with a casual and sometimes coy shrug of the shoulders. She was very humble and human, after all, which I think has gotten lost in the recent wave of anglophone writing about her, in which she’s often placed on a pedestal, approached only through a philosophical or feminist lens, portrayed as some marble goddess. When we set out to curate her portfolio, it was with a mind to counter this perception, or at least to complicate it by offering a multifarious portrait of Clarice the writer, the painter, the pen pal, the sister, the diplomat’s wife, the devoted mother…\n\n\tDM: …and the author of The Woman Who Killed the Fish! In at least one respect we have it easy, since most of our featured artists have been at their metier for a long time—often three decades or more. This results in a surfeit of material to choose from: untranslated work, autobiographical writings, critical analyses from different parts of the world, appreciations by fellow artists, and so on. In the case of Lispector, our wish list was long from the start and we were lucky to obtain most of the items we’d wanted. But delightful items surface during late stages, too. Rachael Allen’s tribute to Mary Ruefle was one such fortunate inclusion. When we discovered that Rachael adored Mary’s poetry and prose, Issue 4 had already been edited. But the opportunity to invite her to submit an appreciation was too dear to renounce. What came of this—an original reading of the poet as fabulist—was so good that we used it to open Ruefle’s section of the issue.\n\n\tTDVA: I’ll add too that these portfolios are constructed in such a way that they remain current: as more of Krasznahorkai’s work becomes available in English and as more of Vladimír Godár’s music is recorded and distributed by record labels with reach to the Western world, our portfolios on their work—completist as they are—will help support these releases. And here is where Daniel’s placement in Paris and frequent travels across Europe for his various other projects—not to mention his command of four languages—is a tremendous boon for our editorial efforts, especially with the portfolios on those authors whose work is available in French and German but not in English. This, in combination with our close collaborations with our featured artists themselves (or their heirs), grants us the ability to obtain, assess, and curate huge amounts of material in order to shape an optimal collection. As Daniel mentioned, this is the fun of the project: in a very real way, we reinvent the magazine with each successive portfolio. Indeed, there tend to be a lot of moving parts constantly in play during an issue’s development—sometimes even right up to the week we submit it to the printer—that very often lead to new and unexpected opportunities and that can sometimes block off certain possibilities, but achieving a sort of intimacy, in some form or another, with the featured artist and her work is always of chief importance, and is often what guides our efforts.\n\t    Our most common hurdles are time (we solicit almost all of the work, and much of it also needs to undergo translation), negotiating rights, and, above all else, securing funding.\n\n\t\n\n\tThe violinist Filip Pogády performing a piece composed by Barry Guy for his wife Maya Homburger\n\n\tMB: Do you have a sense of an underlying commonality among the artists or writers you are highlighting? For instance, in Issue 2, László Krasznahorakai has worked with Béla Tarr and Max Neumann, the three of whom make up the featured artists of the issue. That’s an easy one. And in Issue 4, there is a great essay by Mary Ruefle, whose work is also given a retrospective in that issue. Some choices feel more autonomous, for instance Gerald Murnane and Vladimír Godár, or Arvo Pärt and Herbert Selby Jr. Does relation play a role in how you put an issue together?\n\n\tDM: I’d love to claim that we have from the start, but we’re still new to this: hard to believe that Issue 2—our first collaboration—was launched exactly one year ago! When Taylor approached me with the idea of devoting an issue of M&L to Krasznahorkai, I immediately proposed Neumann and Tarr as the other artists. In that case, the common denominator’s obvious, but there was no sense of a larger program, not least because my work was undertaken for Issue 2 alone. That changed over the course of last spring and summer, as we discussed Issue 3 and its launch. (To the joys mentioned above let me add this too: the joy of collaboration, where one person’s idea begets another’s.) Today we are more conscious about seeking out commonalities between artists. We even try to encourage new ones by introducing work by previous contributors to potential future ones, and vice versa.\n\n\tTDVA: As we continue to encourage cross-pollination between art forms and artists, the less obvious connections tend to reveal themselves. Often the connection is totally obscured, but there’s a hunch or simply a desire to get someone we admire involved with the M&L project, either as a contributing author or as a presenter at one of our events. \n\t    In the end, the underlying thread is less an aesthetic quality than it is our passion for an individual’s work. As a staff, our tastes and realms of expertise vary quite a bit, but there’s also plenty of overlap. One of the great joys of working with Daniel, Jeffrey, and Madeleine, is the constant pinging of enthusiasms and recommendations between us, and the new possibilities which arise from our shared excitement. We’re an all-volunteer staff at this point. The passion for the project at large is what fuels us—and it’s what attracts our growing network of writers, musicians, translators, conductors, painters, et al.\n\n\t\n\n\tMusic & Literature editors Daniel Medin and Taylor Davis-Van Atta\n\n\tMB: How closely do you work with the artists and/or their representatives whose work you are gathering by and about them? Krasznahorkai, for instance, provided you with personal photos from his pilgrimage to Japan and is thanked for his close collaboration in recommending essays. Is their assistance an integral part of your acquisitions process? And how do you approach contributors? It was exciting to see writers like Teju Cole and Hari Kunzru praise the work of a writer like Gerald Murnane. How did you become aware of their admiration for his work?\n\n\tTDVA: The formation of each issue is a highly collaborative process. From the very beginning, the full cooperation of the featured artist has been a prerequisite for a portfolio devoted to their work: it’s the only way in which we’re able to offer a global—in every sense of the word—perspective on their entire career. Before we commit to featuring any artist, we have a far-ranging discussion with that artist or with the manager of their estate, in which we lay out the ambition behind the project, seek their recommendations, and plot out a strategy—not only for obtaining the materials we wish to publish but also in terms of our live programming and how we might best use the publication to promote the artist’s work around the world. If this sounds methodical, it both is and isn’t: we allow ourselves free rein and there’s a great deal of inspiration over the year or more that it takes to curate an issue, and what we end up publishing is often very different from our initial vision, but constant is the diversity and quality of the material.\n\n\tDM: Inspiration and serendipity play a significant role. The online feature of “Krasznahorkai’s Pilgrimages” is an excellent example. When Seiobo There Below was awarded the Best Translated Book Award, we wanted to celebrate. Making Paul Kerschen’s piece about Seiobo and its precursors available seemed a fitting way to uncork the champagne, not least since Paul’s essay addresses the title slated to appear next, Destruction and Sorrow beneath the Heavens (which Seagull Books will publish in 2015). But we wanted to complement the text somehow, so I asked László whether he had photographs from his Asian travels at hand in New York. He didn’t, but his wife, who was back in Hungary at that moment, sent precisely those images the same evening. We could have never imagined they would depict him at a private showing of manuscripts by Ze’ami! Hari Kunzru’s contribution was a similar gift. He happened to read The Plains during the long train ride back to Brooklyn after Issue 2’s launch in upper Manhattan. There was an enthusiastic tweet about Murnane which didn’t escape our notice—and the rest is history.\n\n\t\n\n\tM&L digital editor Jeffrey Zuckerman\n\n\tMB: Music & Literature has a beautiful website that greatly expands upon what you are capable of in print.  For instance, the great essay “On Space and Place,\" is a mediation of the possibilities of online literature, including Peter Turchi’s amazing Roads Not Taken, and happily uses technology such as animated gifs to enhance the piece. Do you see the Music & Literature print and website serving two different missions?\n\n\tDM: I’d call them two aspects of the same mission. When we began to discuss the new website, the team shared a desire to provide original content, along with reviews and features that would reinforce the print issue. But credit here goes to our digital editor, Jeffrey Zuckerman, who overlapped with Taylor for a time at Dalkey Archive, and who was added to the M&L staff around the time of the release of Issue 3 last fall. He constructed the website and now solicits and edits the overwhelming majority of its content.\n\n\tTDVA: Our digital programming is integral to the print editions in a couple of key ways: our features often result from an initial contact with a potential featured artist and serve as a precursor for future collaboration; and our reviews section allows us to give continued support to our featured artists and contributors by offering a venue where we can add to the body of literature about their work as their careers evolve. We’ll soon add a Digital Music Editor to staff to help us bolster the music coverage on the site.\n\n\t\n\n\tNew Directions digital and marketing associate Mieke Chew\n\n\tMB: The musician in me (a drummer) has a question: I noticed that not every print issue of Music & Literature features a musician or composer, but every issue thus far has featured a writer, sometimes two. For instance there is no featured composer in Issue 2 (I’d have loved to have read an essay on Mihály Vig, who composed the soundtracks to all of the Tarr/Krasznahorkai films). Do you see yourselves as primarily a literary journal? Could you envision an issue that does not highlight a writer?\n\n\tTDVA: I could easily envision an issue that doesn’t feature a writer. As I mentioned at the outset, Music & Literature is an arts magazine, broadly defined, and we allow ourselves free rein in all aspects of programming. My background is as a reader and a violinist, but my interests both personally and professionally extend to all forms of art—and the more cross-pollination the better! Though we chose not to feature a composer in Issue 2, the volume quite naturally contains a lot of musical material, including George Szirtes discussing the musical complexities of Krasznahorkai’s prose and the difficult pleasure of rendering them into English, as well as a discussion of opera and the nature of evil between László and composer Péter Eötvös.\n\n\tDM: And of course David Auerbach’s analysis of the musical metaphor at the heart of Melancholy of Resistance.\n\n\tTDVA: This also gets back to our earlier discussion, since the live events we put on celebrating the release of Issue 3 featured musicians performing pieces by composers associated with the issue’s featured artists, and in this way, a complementary musical element was integrated into our programming around the issue.\n\n\tDM: Right. I should add that, given more favorable circumstances and a later deadline, Mihály Vig might have well have appeared in Issue 2. (Who’s to say that he won’t some day turn up as the subject of an online feature or in print as a contributor on a featured composer?) I will however concede the greater challenge of assembling material dedicated to composers and performers—especially for the print edition, where we cannot embed individual clips. It’s much easier to represent fiction with words than it is to represent music with words. That said, each successive portfolio elicits new means to do so.\n\n\t\n\n\tA member of the audience\n\n\tMB: What’s coming up for Issues 5 & 6? You guys tweeted recently about Alejandra Pizarnik whose late work we’ll be bringing out in a large collection next year in a translation by Yvette Siegert. How did her work find its way onto your radar?\n\n\tTDVA: Introducing Pizarnik to the M&L staff was like dropping a match in a tinderbox: the response was immediate and all-consuming. Once one of us had a copy of A Musical Hell in hand, an entire week hadn’t passed before everyone on staff had read it and the rejoicing (and research) commenced!\n\n\tDM: An unforgettable voice. Poems compact in their dryness and solitude, like pebbles. I owe my discovery of her work to Ypsilon Éditeur, a small French press that has done many of Pizarnik’s books, all of them in gorgeous translations. But also to Le Comptoir des mots, the bookshop around the corner that displayed these books prominently. And finally, to Eliana Kan, who brought the New Directions pamphlet to my attention when she picked it as one of her favorites of last year for Scott Esposito’s blog. Nothing teaches gratitude better than literary communities like these. Which reminds me of one more aspiration for the M&L project: to reach allied readers in English, but across others languages as well. Our second issue was launched in Berlin alongside a new number of Vagant, Norway’s most eminent literary journal. They featured an introduction to Krasznahorkai, an excerpt from Satantango, and one of the essays collected in our volume. I’d like to believe that the future will hold more such polyglot collaborations—and celebrations—in store.\n\n\tTDVA: We’re hard at work on seven or eight new portfolios at the moment, including the previously mentioned collection devoted to Kaija Saariaho, which will headline Issue 5. Readers can prime themselves for forthcoming issues by visiting our website, where previews of work by future featured and contributing artists can be found. Before all else, however, we’re off to Paris later this month to continue our celebration of Issue 4!\n\n\t\n\n\tMieke and Taylor at the after party\n\n\t***\n\n\tMichael Barron is an editor and the director of publicity at New Directions.\n\n\tJesse Ruddock is an editor at Seven Stories Press and a freelance photographer. \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     “Stealth” Book Trailer\n  \n  \n    Pneumatic Antiphonal: An Interview with Sylvia Legris \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

For eleven months, the King gives her all the worldly pleasure she desires. Then one day, he takes the maiden to a spinning room and tells her to spin five skeins by nightfall or else she will lose her head. The maiden is left sobbing in the room, and the sound of her weeping soon catches the attention of a little imp to whom she confesses her plight. He can spin five skeins in a day, he says, and makes her an offer: in exchange for his work she has to give herself fully to the imp by the month’s end. But if she can guess his name within that time, she will be free from fulfilling her end of the bargain. His name is, she serendipitously discovers in the nick of time, Tom Tit Tot.\n\t   \n\n\tIn Susan Howe’s eponymous new work now being shown at the Whitney Biennial, the process is reversed. Encased in glass, pages from Tom Tit Tot rest against a bare white wall on the Biennial’s second floor. These don’t provoke your eye the way other flashier work attempts to, you have to seek them out. On the wall text adjacent describes Howe’s process: she makes “copies of the source material—American, British, and Irish folklore, poetry, art criticism, and historical documents—which range from the excerpts of the texts themselves to footnotes and marginalia. From these she cuts out sentences and fragments, pasting and taping them to create a new text that retains the typefaces, spacing, and rhythm of the originals.” Unlike the little imp, it is not skeins Howe is spinning, but texts pulled from various archives that collide and fuse into clipped encoded passages — literature “sampled.” Through this process, contrained only by method and visual aesthetic, Howe uncovers new meanings within the texts’ original intent. \n\n\t \n\n\t\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\tIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Howe insisted that these works aren’t meant to be impenetrable. “They are meant to be read,” she said. “I believe that every mark on paper is acoustic. So the sight and sound of a letter or even the piece of one, a crossout, a misspelling etc., has a visual and acoustic effect that is part of meaning.” Howe has devised a way to navigate her own hermetic creations, in effect unsealing them, by reading these passages down to their phonetic bones. In the audio guide freely provided by the Whitney, you can hear Howe read from Frolic Architecture — a text created by a similar method to Tom Tit Tot— with ambient tones provided by her longtime collaborator: musician and sound artist David Grubbs. Emerging like bubbles from Grubbs’s sonic drones, Howe’s voice truncates and stumbles like sounds trapped by a skipping CD, almost nothing escapes into sonality except for an occasional disembodied phrase (“find a bewildered ever”) or the spare burst of directed air (“ah” ... “t—”).\n\t   \n\n\tThough Howe has expressed “feeling like an oddity” among the featured artists, Tom Tit Tot is one of the most majestic works amid notably literary company at the Biennial. Along with Howe’s Tom Tit Tot, gathered here are David Foster Wallace’s journals and scratch notes; a room devoted to French criticism curated by Semiotext(e); an installation of reproduced art by the online magazine Triple Canopy; examples of hectographic printing used by spies, and fliers announcing talks by New Directions poet and self-proclaimed avant-gardist David Anton. But what singles out Howe’s work is her penchant for the verbal as well as the visual — in essence, she creates works of art that may comfortably be at home in a glass case or within the covers of a book. She uses text in the same way a painter uses oils, or as Howe succinctly puts it: “The bibliography is the medium.”\n\t  \n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t \n\n\tThis October, New Directions and art book publisher Christine Burgin will release Howe’s newest work, Spontaneous Particulars: The Telepathy of Archives. It is no surprise that Howe’s work found a home with an art publisher. Written in a similar vein to My Emily Dickinson, this beautifully bound hardcover book lavishly illustrated with photographs from the archived manuscripts of great American writers (William Carlos Williams, Hart Crane, Jonathan Edwards, Gertrude Stein, Emily Dickinson) as well as textiles. Howe calls the essay a “collaged swan song to the old ways” of material research. Spontaneous Particulars along with Tom Tit Tot and Frolic Architecture (which can be found in That This, published by New Directions) are beautiful examples of why Susan Howe may just be the greatest artist ever produced by a library.\n\n\tSusan Howe’s Tom Tit Tot is on view at the Whitney’s second floor galleries until May 25. \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     New Kamau Brathwaite Poem: eQuinox Passing\n  \n  \n    An evening with Jenny Erpenbeck and Susan Bernofsky: TONIGHT \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Bolaño’s love of reading informed much of his own writing, and in a short autobiographical piece, he claimed to be “much happier reading than writing.” In this sense, probably the best way to continue reading Bolaño is to read like Bolaño.\n\n\tIt can be difficult to pinpoint his exact literary taste—he seems to favor some books for their inexplicable style, and some writers for their bravery or fortitude—so we’ve put together a collection of authors who Bolaño admired and wanted to engage with, who are published by New Directions.\n\n\t* * *\n\n\t1. I dreamt I was sixteen and Martín Adán was giving me piano lessons. The old man’s fingers, long as the Amazing Rubber Man’s, plunged through the floor and played a chain of underground volcanoes.\n\n\t2. If there’s currently a writer who defies all classification that writer is César Aira… Once you’ve read Aira, you don’t want to stop… Aira is an eccentric, but he’s also one of the three or four best Spanish—language writers alive today.\n\n\t3. Readers of Baudelaire don’t have it easy in high school, or with their schoolmates, much less with their teachers. But their fragility is deceptive. So is their humor and the fickleness of their declarations of love. Behind these shadowy fronts are probably the toughest people in the world, and definitely the bravest.\n\n\t4. [Adolfo] Bioy Casares wrote Latin America’s first and best fantastic novel, though all the writers of Latin America rush to deny it.\n\n\t5. One must reread Borges.\n\n\t6. Ernesto Cardenal’s voice hasn’t changed but everything else has changed, and what was once hope, an invitation to the unknown (or so it seemed to us), now seems more like silence and stillness, a silence and stillness emanating from a lost province where Cardenal still lives and goes about his business, despite all the battles he’s lost, recounting in stately prose the vicissitudes of his family, because that’s what Vida perdida is about, the fate of a family and the fate of a man who’s one of the great poets of Latin America, plus sketches of some friends who live on after death, like the great American writer Thomas Merton, also a priest, and what we’re left with in the end is a life that’s more triumph than failure: a final image of Cardenal as a man who lives in limbo, which isn’t a bad way to live, next door to heaven.\n\n\t7. Horacio Castellanos Moya is a melancholic and he writes as if from the bottom of one of his country’s many volcanoes. This sounds like magic realism. But there’s nothing magic about his books, except possibly the boldness of his style. He’s a survivor, but he doesn’t write like a survivor.\n\n\t8. There is a secret slot for [Camilo José] Cela at his best, as one of the great prose stylists, plural, of Spain in the second half of the twentieth century, as a human being happy with his wife Marina, as a man dangerously like us.\n\n\t9. Louis-Ferdinand Céline, a great writer and son of a bitch. Just an abject human being. It’s incredible that the coldest moments of his abjection are covered under an aura of nobility, which is only attributable to the power of words.\n\n\t10. I’m moved by the fortitude of young people who read [Julio] Cortázar and [Nicanor] Parra, just as I once read them and as I try to read them still. I’m moved by young people who sleep with books under their heads. A book is the best pillow there is.\n\n\t17. As far as I’m concerned, Parra has long been the best living poet in the Spanish language.\n\n\t11. You must read Felisberto Hernández.\n\n\t12. Literature is a dangerous game. Which leads us straight to Alfred Jarry, who had a gun and liked to shoot\n\n\t13. Kafka, this century’s best writer.\n\n\t14. I dreamt that one afternoon they were banging on the door to my house. It was snowing. I didn’t have a stove or any money. I think they were even going to cut off the electricity. And who was on the other side of the door? Enrique Lihn with a bottle of wine, a bag of food and a check from the Unknown University.\n\n\t15. Mallarmé, the least innocent of all the great poets, says that we must travel, we must set off traveling again… Mallarmé wants to start all over again, even though he knows that the voyage and the voyagers are doomed.\n\n\t16. Best New York gangster: Kenneth Patchen.\n\n\t17. When I woke up, my good friend Ulises was reading. I asked him what book he was reading. Ezra Pound’s Selected Poems. Read something to me, I said. I didn’t understand any of it. I stopped trying.\n\n\t18. [Rodrigo] Rey Rosa is the consummate master, the best of my generation, which happens to include many excellent short-story writers.\n\n\t19. We ignored everyone, except for Rimbaud and Lautréamont.\n\n\t20. I dreamt I was reading Stendhal in the Civitavecchia Nuclear Station: a shadow was sliding across the tiles of the reactors. It’s Stendhal’s ghost, said a young man in boots, naked from the waist up.\n\n\t21. I even regarded the loss of my teeth as a kind of homage to Gary Snyder, whose life of Zen wandering had led him to neglect dental care.\n\n\t22. The work of Enrique Vila-Matas, César Aira, and Javier Marías, a Catalan, an Argentine, and a writer from Madrid, probably the three authors farthest out ahead in the new territory to explore. What is this new territory? The same as it always is, but different, which is a way of saying that I don’t know.\n\n\t23.

She’s been working for Rodrigo Corral Design Studio for the last couple years and has done some great work for us, including the recent designs in our Pearl series, a couple of which, such a Keith Ridgway’s Never Love a Gambler (shown above), were listed in Print magazine’s recent feature \"19 Striking Book Covers of 2014.\" Last week, I had a chance to ask her some questions.\n\n\t* * * \n\n\tKelsey Ford: How did you get into book design?\n\n\tRachel Adam: I had a really unusual path. I went to Colgate and studied Political Science and then ended up working in advertising. I really liked creativity and was a pretty creative person but didn’t really think that I could make a career out of it myself, so the next best thing was to go into advertising and work with designers. I did that for awhile. Then I realized I wanted to see if I could do this myself. When I was 25, I enrolled in a portfolio program at Parsons. I worked full-time and went to school part-time. I really wanted to be a book cover designer, which felt impossible because that’s what everybody wants to do and there are so few of them out there. But I figured, if I’m going this far, I might as well just shoot for the moon and see if I can do it. I ended up getting an internship with Rodrigo Corral Design and that became a job. I’ve been working here at the studio every since.\n\t     I think the interesting thing is having not studied graphic design in undergrad, and coming from a different background, people ask me all the time, “How did you do it? I want to transition. I want to have a more creative career.” It’s totally doable! It’s nice to hear an alternative way for people to have gotten to where they are. I remember sitting there, working in advertising, thinking, “Oh my gosh, I really want to be a graphic designer. What do I do? Is it possible? Can I just change my career?” I tried to seek out people who had done that as well, and it was nice to hear that it was possible — that I wasn’t doomed at 25. It’s the question I get asked the most.\n\n\tKF: Why did you want to become a book designer?\n\n\tRA: I love books. I think they’re amazing, beautiful objects. I could not imagine anything cooler than basically helping them come to life. For me, if you think about the book as an object itself, a full bookshelf is basically an art collection. On top of that, I love to read. I can consume a book in a day very happily.\n\n\tKF: Is there an author, a series of books, or one book that you’ve wanted to redesign?\n\n\tRA: I always thought it would be fun to redesign boring looking textbooks. Just do something totally insane so that some high school kid thinks, “Oh my god, that’s my history book? Sweet!”\n\n\tKF: What’s your typical process like?\n\n\tRA: Once I sit down at the computer, I do a bunch of research. I create a folder and just throw everything under the sun in there that could be relevant, like comparison titles and covers. Even just a paint swatch that I’d found on Pinterest. And then, from there, I come up with a concept. It’s one thing to make something look good, but the meat of designing any book cover is the idea behind it. The goal of the research and brainstorming is inspiration:  whether it’s your concept, the book itself, the references you’ve collected, the research you’ve done. Then hopefully, a cover begins to materialize.\n\n\tKF: I know that you’ve done a lot of the recent Pearl designs and redesigns. What’s it like working with that series?\n\n\tRA: Well, for the Pearls, it’s not a total, complete redesign — you still have the white background, the geometric shapes, a single color. So it’s more like tweaking the rules a little bit. Or using the rules to make something else. The Pearls are so much fun to do. Just a stream-of-consciousness act.\n\n\tKF: Do you have favorite book designers?\n\n\tRA: Definitely Rodrigo. And of course the other big ones: Chip Kidd, Peter Mendelsund, John Gall. They’re so good. Not to mention many, many others. I think also — and this may sound strange — but Bill Watterson, who did Calvin & Hobbes, was a huge influence on me. When I was in grade school, we could order books from those old Scholastic catalogs that they would hand out in class and I thought Bill Watterson made the most beautiful books in the whole world. The writing was amazing, so I would have read Calvin & Hobbes anyway. But the way he used different mediums and color and space was so exciting. It was the first time I remember realizing how dynamic and beautiful a book could be –– I’ll probably always take my love of his stuff with me in various ways. I saved all his comic strips from the Sunday paper. I wouldn’t describe him as a book designer, but he clearly cared about designing for print and he made me realize I cared too.\n\n\t* * *\n\n\tMore of Rachel Adam’s design work can be found at racheladam.com.\n\n\tKelsey Ford is the director of eBooks and permissions at New Directions.

Each character can be viewed as a different response to Mishima’s preoccupation with death, for example, the actor—wonderfully restaged in Paul Schrader’s film Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters—uses pain and masochism to verify his existence, but this verification can only find completion in a painful death. Through these characters, Mishima seemingly begins to envision and theorize what his death should be like.\n\t     The following year, just after Kyoko’s House was published, Mishima died onscreen for the first time. In a gangster film Afraid to Die, he played the lead role of a fatalistic tough guy trying to escape from a life of crime. His character, Takeo, is a mixture of energetic swagger and doom: he flaunts his gun and muscular torso, slaps his pregnant girlfriend in every other scene, and, of course, meets his destiny with an assassin’s bullet. The final scene of the film lacks all of the solemnity and dignity of Mishima’s later deaths—it almost borders on slapstick: after getting shot, he falls onto an upward-moving escalator, and then, with his last spasms of life, he struggles to return to his girlfriend but can’t make it back down the escalator’s moving steps.\n\t     In a stark aesthetic contrast, “Patriotism”—written a few months later, during the summer of 1960—gives a somberly poetic description of a young couple’s double suicide. Based on the actual 1936 failed uprising in Tokyo, the story follows a handsome lieutenant who’s been spared from dying in a hopeless military rebellion because of his recent and seemingly idyllic marriage. The story then details the couple’s final evening of lovemaking and their ritual suicide. “Patriotism” gives a much clearer image of the ideals that Mishima was beginning to wholeheartedly embrace: here, he articulates his lasting political convictions (which had been shifting from nihilism to ultranationalist emperor worship); his personal desire for a heroic, honorable, and torturously painful death; and the condition and psychology of duty, which is now perceived as—depending on who’s looking—an extremism related to terrorism, or blindly dogmatic bravura. In short, “Patriotism” is one of the most Mishimaesque stories.\n\t     After publishing “Patriotism,” Mishima got the idea to bring his story to the screen. But rather than selling the film rights of “Patriotism”—and because it was his favorite story—Mishima decided to make the film himself. Perhaps because of his previous experiences in the film industry—with its commercialism and inevitable compromises—he hid this project from the large production companies, as well as the Japanese public, who might have regarded his directorial debut as just another one of his publicity stunts. (By that point, Mishima’s stunts had become notorious, to the extent that Javier Marias later suggested, “his non-stop exhibitionism had been merely a way of getting people’s attention for the culminating moment.”)\n\t     Filmed in just two hectic days in 1965, Mishima directed, produced, and starred in Patriotism. He decided to release the film abroad initially, for similar reasons that he kept its production a secret. It premiered to a private audience in Paris—with an enthusiastic reception—and then a few months later it was included in the prestigious Tours Film Festival, where it caused a minor sensation: during the gruesome scene of the suicide some of the audience members either fainted or became violently nauseous.\n\t     This strange short film—not much longer than a sitcom episode—relies less on cinematic language than on the sparse setting and visual cues it borrows from Noh Theater. Except for a warbling recording of Wagner’s “Liebestod” in the background, Patriotism is entirely silent. The plot is truncated as well, so each gesture becomes immense: the lieutenant and his wife cherish their last precious moments together with tender caresses, then the husband meticulously follows the procedure for a ceremonial death. His wife presents him with a tanto blade and, the young lieutenant stabs the knife into his stomach, spilling blood and entrails (the latter were pig intestines purchased from a butcher—by the time they were used for the suicide scene, they had rotted, and stunk up the entire set), and finally, a few moments later, the faithful wife sinks a blade into her own neck.\n\t     To say nothing of the film’s violent eroticism, anti-feminist ideals, or slightly passé experimentalisms, watching Patriotism today is particularly troubling as a prelude to Mishima’s actual death. His extravagant suicide, which occurred about five years after the film was released, contained many of the same elements, turning Patriotism into a prototype or prophetic rehearsal.\n\t     Reality and literature seem to collide in Mishima’s final exit, as some sort of quixotic self-plagiarism with such strange implications that John Nathan—his biographer and English translator—suggested Mishima’s attempted military takeover was only a half-baked pretext to die gloriously. To put in another way, it’s almost as though Mishima manipulated all of the circumstances of his death to recreate the ideals of honor, duty, and erotic violence that he expressed most severely, most paradigmatically in Patriotism. \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Clarice Lispector Interview\n  \n  \n    ND on Design: An interview with Rachel Adam \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

But affinity, literary and otherwise, can be unpredictable. Under the fluorescent lights of the New York University basement classroom where I first read the poems of the Argentine poet Oliverio Girondo (1890-1967), I could never have imagined the challenging, whimsical companion he would become.\n\n\tGirondo made a reputation for himself on both sides of the Atlantic with his debut collection, Veinte poemas para ser leídos en el tranvía [Twenty Poems to Read on a Streetcar], which in turn inspired the title of the recently published New Directions pamphlet. He further cemented his reputation by co-founding the avant-garde Martín Fierro group and penning the seminal manifesto of the Buenos Aires collective’s eponymous magazine.\n\n\tGirondo released his next collection—Espantapájaros (al alcance de todos) [Scarecrow (Within Reach of All)]—with a wild publicity stunt. Following his own dictum that “a book should be made like a watch and sold like a sausage,” Girondo hired a funeral carriage and two drivers in formal attire to cart a giant papier-mâché “scarecrow” in a top hat and monocle around Buenos Aires while attractive young women sold copies of the book from a storefront downtown. The print run sold out almost immediately; the scarecrow was retired to the house on calle Suipacha where Girondo lived with his wife, the writer Norah Lange, to preside over the many animated literary fêtes they hosted.\n\n\t\n\n\tThe Scarecrow at his new home in the Museum of the City of Buenos Aires\n\n\tScarecrow (Within Reach of All)—Girondo’s second venture into prose poetry—is introduced by a calligram in the shape of a scarecrow whose head is composed of a full declension of the phrase “to know nothing” and whose viscera assert, “I believe I believe what I believe I don’t believe.” It was this poem that I read in that basement classroom, and this poem that I happened upon again years later, while looking for material for a translation workshop. But it wasn’t until this second encounter that I was finally able to hear the magnanimous insolence of Girondo’s poetic voice—a defining characteristic of his early work.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tGirondo’s scarecrow calligram\n\n\tAs it turns out, this proto-Concrete calligram was an ideal point of entry into Girondo’s work (fortunately, I did have a second chance to get a first impression). Condensing the gestures at undermining institutional authority—of universities, governments, businesses— seen throughout the poet’s oeuvre, the schoolhouse chant at the poem’s “head” calls its own pedagogical aim into question through its insistence on the absence of knowledge; the series of rhymes that follows performs a similar function, indicting the educational system and celebrating “our natural predilection for meditation, contemplation, and masturbation.” The gist: poetry is not something to be relegated to the ivory tower or the salon. It is something to be plucked like “scraps from the pavement” and appreciated in much the same way—on streetcars and in plazas, colloquially and viscerally.\n\n\tThis insistence on “guttural” expression is not only part of Girondo’s quest to democratize poetic form, it is also tied to his relationship to language. Much of the poet’s later work, in fact, tries to drive the written word—through phonetic play and neologism—in the direction of sensory experience, away from codified, “corroded” versions of itself. This is particularly true of his final collection, En la masmédula [In the Moremarrow; 1963], a kaleidoscopic tumult of denotation and sound, though there are signs of it in the poet’s previous work.\n\n\tIn the first book of Girondo’s poems that I translated—Persuasión de los días [The Persuasion of Days; 1942]—the natural realm is associated more than anything with this immediacy—the poetic voice moves from an urban sphere consumed by greed and indifference to a space where he can rediscover “the stream’s easy bareness” and other pleasures grounded more in hush than hustle.

He’s had quite a life—revolutionary, Catholic priest, liberation theologian, founder of a commune and eventual artists’ colony, sculptor, teacher, political leader, and internationally renowned poet.\n\n\tBorn in Granada, on the northern shore of Lake Nicaragua, Cardenal wrote his first poem when he was 6 years old. He started publishing love poems in his early twenties while growing political. After participating in a failed coup at 29, he retreated to a monastic life, and spent time in the United States at the Abbey of Gethsemani. There he befriended Thomas Merton who championed his fellow contemplative poet. Cardenal eventually returned to his native Nicaragua where he was ordained a priest. On the Solentiname Islands he founded a Christian commune that would become an artists’ colony. Later Cardenal helped lead the Sandinista revolutionaries to overthrow the Somoza regime. For nearly a decade following the victory of the Sandinista Revolution, he was Nicaragua’s Minister of Culture, encouraging the creation of arts and culture nationwide, as he had done locally on Solentiname.\n\n\tCardenal has published more than two dozen books of poetry, matched with at least that many anthologies of his work. He continues to write poems—not to mention being outspoken as always, calling things the way he sees them. Though a leader of the Sandinista Revolution, he left the Sandinista party 20 years ago, and has criticized it ever since. Now, Cardenal lives a relatively quiet life in Managua, writing and giving occasional readings throughout the world. He has published his memoirs in three volumes: Vida perdida (Lost Life), Las ínsulas extrañas (Strange Islands), and La revolución perdida (Lost Revolution). “They read like novels,” he once told me.\n\n\tHis longtime American publisher, New Directions, has published three acclaimed collections of his poetry, of which Pluriverse is the latest, offering the most comprehensive selection of his poems in English. About Pluriverse Three Percent wrote: “Readers of English, thank your gods: the breadth of Ernesto Cardenal’s amazing poetic career is now available for our consumption.”\n\n\tAt the 92nd Street Y as part of PEN’s 2011 World Voices Festival, I was honored to read my translations of his work as we stood together on stage in front of a packed house. We had a lot of fun that night. Though it was a celebration of Cardenal’s life and achievements—with thunderous applause—it was also a glowing moment in our friendship that had begun in 1970. I was then a college boy exploring “American” poetry with a burgeoning interest in Latin America. I had translated his book Prayer for Marilyn Monroe and Other Poems and sent him the manuscript. He wrote back that he liked my translations, and that I should submit them to ND, which was preparing to publish its first collection of his poetry. Merton, his old mentor and friend, had introduced James Laughlin to his work.\n\n\tCardenal has received several major international awards and honors. His latest is the 2012 Queen Sofia Ibero-American Poetry Prize for his contribution to the cultural legacy of Latin America and Spain. Among his other awards are the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade, Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award, Pablo Neruda Ibero-American Poetry Prize, GLOBArt Award, and Austrian Cross of Honor for Science and Art, First Class. He has also been shortlisted for the Nobel Prize for Literature more than once.\n\n\tSo let us celebrate Cardenal as he begins his 90th year—for all he has done as a poet to gladden our hearts and enrich our souls. ¡Viva Cardenal! ¡Viva la poesía!\n\n\t \n\n\t \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     A Q & A With The Quay Brothers\n  \n  \n    A Book Should Be Made Like A Watch And Sold Like A Sausage \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Inside of a packed house, the identical Brothers, Stephen and Timothy, first introduced a wonderfully vivacious short live-action modern dance film, Maska, before unveiling the feature presentation. The Brothers were quick to point out that they had only seen the film once before on screen, and only a couple of hours after putting on the fininshing touches. \"It is a work that can be expanded\" one of them exclaimed before lights went out. Yet the disclaimer seemed unnecessary—Unmistaken Hands is a brief and majestic stop-motion animation that deftly conjures Hernández’s paranoid world of the subconcious. \n\n\tFor those familiar with the films of the Quay Brothers (and who were fortuntate to see their MOMA retrospective last year), Unmistaken Hands follows on their long tradition of visualing literature through a lens. Rather than a straight-forward retelling of the narrative, the Brothers seek to pull out the essence of a writer’s work by employing recurring motifs and the idiosyncracies of language. Thus Bruno Schulz’s Street of Crocodiles is a silent journey by a Jozef-like figure who navigates a labyrintine box city and discovers (or is discovered by) a strange room of glowy-eyed tailors. The Brothers’s first full-length feature, Institute Benjamenta, interprets  Robert Walser’s Jakob Von Gunten as a living, breathing space.\n\n\tWhen I sent the Quay Brothers a cold fan email describing our adventure to see Unmistaken Hands, they sent me a polite but enthusiastic reply. Depsite a busy schedule, including a weeklong residency at Hungarian Filmmaker Bela Tarr’s film academy in Bosnia-Herzogovina, the Brothers graciously responded to a few questions. As they note below, Unmistaken Hands was greatly inspired by two of Hernández’s short stories—\"The Balcony\" and \"The Flooded House\"—both of which appear our new edition of his collection Piano Stories.\n\n\t* * *\n\n\tNew Directions: How did you come to discover the work of Felisberto Hernandez?\n\n\tQuay Brothers: In the mid-1980s we read a small essay on the \"fantastic\" in Latin American literature by Julio Cortázar. Through his beautiful description of Hernández’s work, we were introduced to his eccentric characters and stories, and in particular, to his marvelous story \"The Flooded House.\"\n\n\tND: What about his fiction inspired you to create Unmistaken Hands: Ex Voto F.H.? Is it based on a specific story?\n\n\tQQ: Hernández writes so fabulously on objects and presences. He was a master at unveiling that shadowy, elusive unmarked boundary line between the empirical world and the living things within it, which is so negotiably subtle, pliant, and secretive. The film uses themes from \"The Balcony\" and \"The Flooded House\" with liberties that the cinema will always be guilty of—hopefully forgivingly. \n\n\tND: Could you talk a bit about the creation of Unmistaken Hands: Ex Voto F.H.?  At the New York premiere, you discussed how you’ve only actually seen the film a couple of times, the finishing touches being applied mere hours before being shown. Is Unmistaken Hands something you feel is complete, or do you have ideas for how it could be further developed?\n\n\tQQ: The film borrows and pays homage to \"fragments & motifs\" from the works of Felisberto Hernández and is ultimately meant to be a pilot film for a much larger film version (for which the script has already been written). So at this stage the film’s a kind of calling card, complete only in the way that a dream often feels powerful and complete even in its fragmentariness. \n\n\tND: How have you embraced new technology in your work as stop-motion animators?\n\n\tQQ: We have two 35mm Mitchell cameras that are, alas, but door stops in our studio. We have been shooting digitally since 2001, sometimes happily, more often frustratingly (as those who have worked with the alchemy of \"film\" know only too well).\n\t\n\tND: Your first feature film—Institute Benjamenta— was based on the Robert Walser novel, Jacob Von Gunten. How did the idea germinate to turn this novel into your first live-action film rather than an animation?\n\n\tQQ: We happened to be reading Walser’s Jakob Von Gunten at that very moment when we were provoked by Keith Griffiths—our long time producer—to consider doing a feature film (just after completing Street of Crocodiles). Initially we balked, but then we felt that the Walser story—if conceived as a chamber work and filmed in a \"found\" space (like a puppet decor)—that it would be manageable and therefore controllable. We know instinctively what live-action could do and what animation could do and, therefore, you then know even better what lay potentially in-between these two realms. \n\t\n\tND: As directors, do you have a guiding philosophy toward adapting literary work to film or animation? Have you ever worked with a writer you admire on a script?\n\n\tQQ: We tend to gravitate towards slightly recalcitrant material and one that ultimately must be transposed into a predominately visual and musical state. We’ve worked on the two feature films with a close writer friend, Alain Passes.\n\t\n\tND: You recently spent a weeklong-residency at Bela Tarr’s Film School in Sarajevo. What was the school like? How involved is Mr. Tarr? Are you admirers of his films and the work of his longtime collaborator, the novelist László Krasznahorkai?\n\n\tQQ: The film school is brand new, not even a year old, with some 25 international students all learning the difficult craft of being \"film directors.\" It’s clearly underfunded, but heroically struggling. Bela is harrassed and troubled, but deeply involved and committed—he’s basically a saint. We not only know and admire the world of Bela’s films but also the writings of his friend and close collaborator László Krasznahorkai.\n\t\n\tND: What’s on the horizon for the Quay Brothers? And when is the next showing of Unmistaken Hands? \n\n\tQQ: We’re collaborating with The Digital Toy Company here in London on a game and also making three short films to be embedded within and to be called: Asleep: I Hear My Name.  It’s a kind of \"Alice in Not-so-Wonderland.\" MoMA plans to show the Unmistaken Hands sometime in the future, but that’s all we can say for now. \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     The Man Who Steel Our Hearts in Robben Island\n  \n  \n    Cardenal at 89 \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Last month, the journal invited poet Alex Cigale to curate a month-long celebration of the life and work of Chuvashian poet, Gennady Aygi. As part of the tribute, Cigale interviewed Peter France, translator of our two books of Aygi’s poetry, Child-And-Rose and Field-Russia. A selection of poems by Osip Mandelstam translated by France will be published in June by New Directions. A volume of Aygi’s Tributes is forthcoming from New Directions.\n\n\t* * *\n\n\t \n\n\tAC: Peter, if I may call you by your first name, would you please tell us first about yourself, your own “story.” How did you first become “involved” with the work of Gennady Aygi? For example, did your work from the French or the Russian come first? How did you, and do you now, balance your interests in various cultures and literatures? How did you first become interested in contemporary poetry? And why Aygi; what were the circumstances of your first meeting with him?\n\t\n\tPF: I had a very British upbringing; in my school years most Brits travelled very little abroad (except as soldiers), though we read a lot about other lands. I finished secondary school in Yorkshire in 1953, and was intending to go on to university to study French and German. But before that came two years of obligatory military service, for most people a pain, for me a great experience. I was one of the many young men of my generation who learned Russian for military purposes, a very intensive course. There was plenty of work on jet engines, military ranks, etc., not much literature, but plenty of language, and when I went to Oxford I switched to a degree in French and Russian. I never became a “Slavist” though; French was always my main foreign language and my university work was almost all French-related or comparative. Russian was a private passion, but it’s come increasingly to the fore since I retired in 2000.\n\t\n\tI’ve always loved poetry, ancient and modern, mainly English poetry in those days (my vade mecum was the Faber Book of Modern Verse). Study in Oxford didn’t go much into modern poetry, though I did read Blok, Mayakovsky and others. I guess I read no poetry like that of Aygi in those days, it was only later I started reading the modern French poets who meant so much to him (Jouve, Char, Jacob, etc.) But luckily my friend the poet Jon Stallworthy suggested that we should translate Blok together – we published a volume in 1970, and then moved on to Pasternak. That’s how I came to meet Gennady. I’d first been to Russia in the Thaw years as an interpreter at a British trade fair in 1961, but didn’t go again until 1974, when I spent a month there talking to some great people about Pasternak. One of these was the (to me) quite unknown figure of Gennady Aygi, of whom I only knew that he had been friendly with Pasternak in the late 1950s. I’d never heard of Chuvashia, and knew almost nothing of Aygi’s poetry.\n\t\n\tWell, it was a great meeting, and changed my life. I had several memorable days talking with him, entering into a friendship that became closer with the years, in spite of the infrequency of my visits to Moscow (and of course he couldn’t come west until 1988). I remember particularly wandering by the ponds and woods that still survived in the South-West district where he was living with his sister – we shared a love of walking and trees. He talked brilliantly, in his special guttural accent, about Pasternak, Mayakovsky, Khlebnikov, Russian and Chuvash cultural life, and lots else. We didn’t really talk about his own poetry, I think, but he gave me quite a lot of it in typescript and I carried it home, trying to make sense of it. And that’s really how I began to translate him, as an exploration, an attempt to enter a different poetic world, a kind of “conversation at a distance” (to use one of his titles). At first I had no idea of publishing the translations, let alone writing about his poetry – that came later.\n\t\n\tAC: I will want to return to a number of things you said, particularly your and Gennady’s shared interest in Pasternak and the French poets you mentioned. For now, may I ask you to tell us about the atmosphere in the Russia of the times. Your second visit coincided with the stagnation of the Brezhnev years. How was it different from the first, during the Khrushchev thaw, and did that effect your ability to freely communicate with Aygi? What was his \"situation\" at the time? Having just returned from teaching two years at the American University of Central Asia, your mention of his accent particularly caught my attention. Accent, as it relates to local flavor and poetic voice has been on my mind recently (clearly a matter of diction and syntax, but also culture and phonology). Might hearing Gennady Aygi’s speaking voice help us to understand the poems better, their performance being such a key aspect? On a related note: Mandelstam often bemoaned his isolation and lack of an interlocutor. Like Mandlestam’s, Aygi’s poems often have an addressee (I am thinking here of Poems addressed to French writers specifically, but also others, to painters for example). The importance of conversation and milieu is often essential to a writer; was this something Aygi lacked in Russia? And so last but not least, your walks together. It’s a love I share, and something closely linked with my image of Aygi and his poems. It has been said that walking, its pace, thinking, perception, has been for many poets associated if not identical with the process of composition itself (the writing is done later.) Would you tell us more specifically about the conversations you had on those long walks together.\n\t\n\tPF: There was plenty of excitement in my first trip to Moscow, in 1961, a festive atmosphere in Sokolniki Park and endless conversations with a public interested in everything western – but I made only one visit to a family, and this was overlaid with fear of the possible consequences (for my hosts).\n\t\n\tIn 1974, and subsequently in the Brezhnev years, I may have been watched, but I felt able to come and go freely and safely by myself, all over Moscow and its suburbs, and to meet with all kinds of writers and intellectuals – no sense of fear, just the need to avoid talking close to a bugged telephone. With Aygi I felt no constraints. He personally was in a difficult situation, having been dismissed from his job at the Mayakovsky Museum. He wasn’t a member of the Writers’ Union, was unpublished in Russia and not welcome in his native Chuvashia, so he made ends meet, more or less, with translation into Chuvash and other literary work. In 1974, I went with him to the pre-screening of a documentary about Chuvashia which he had scripted – it was refused, and hammered for its “formalism,” “pessimism,” etc. But generally, as many people have said, there was a kind of inner freedom during the “years of stagnation.”\n\t\n\tVoice and accent—he was immersed in Russian literary culture and spoke Russian totally fluently, but with a guttural accent that echoed his native Chuvash. There were and are many Russians (and others) unsympathetic to his work who said that he didn’t know the language well enough. As I see it, he had the advantage, like Khlebnikov and Mayakovsky, of coming from elsewhere.\n\t\n\tYes, hearing him speak his poems aloud made all the difference. I can recall the effect of some of his American readings, notably in San Francisco. I don’t like the overuse of the word “shaman,” but when he spoke his poetry it gave meaning to his statement that poetry is a kind of “sacred rite” (sviashchennodeistvie). It was important for translating too; his poems are fragmented visually and syntactically, but bound together with powerful overriding rhythms, often ternary, and English (unlike French I think) can give some idea of this.\n\t\n\tInterlocutors: in 1985, Aygi wrote “For over twenty years I had fewer than a dozen readers.” But he did have a circle of people close to him, the people to whom so many of his poems are dedicated – and this circle widened over the whole world as he became known in translation. While his poetry is inward (on the edge of sleep,) it’s meant for people, to give them “human warmth under the cold sky of the world”. As a person he was very sociable, this side comes out strongly in his occasional poetry (see Winter Revels, published by Rumor Books, San Francisco in 2009).\n\t\n\tAC: Would you please takes us, your readers, along and recount some of your walks with Aygi, and the things you spoke of.\n\t\n\tPF: Rather than trying to remember it all, I think the best thing I can do is quote a bit from the diary I kept at the time: \n\n\t20 September 1974 (first meeting with GA, at his sister’s flat in South-West Moscow, where he gives me bread and tea.) \n\n\tThe talk goes on all day – all sorts of things, mainly poetry and Pasternak. P.’s beauty, gift of happiness – but at the end he was made hysterical by persecution over the Nobel. P. was the alphabet by which young poets learned, though many threw him over afterwards. His dislike of frivolous experiment – e.g. in Zabolotsky. His preference for prose in his last years, taste for Chekhov, contradictory attitude to Nietzsche, writing against him but speaking of him with enthusiasm as the perfect incarnation of art. Immortality an essential theme (influence of Fedorov). G.A. sees poets of Russia in two groups, a) makers of works and b) diary poets (Blok, Tsvetaeva, etc.), the former being closer to western kind (Baudelaire). G.’s belief in the autonomy of art (Proust the exemplar, everything is in Proust), though he also worships Kierkegaard. Great value of Zhivago in revealing new and old western spiritual values in a desert of materialism. Zhivago is a poem. Pasternak thought Khlebnikov didn’t write for readers, but for G.A. Khlebnikov and Guro are central figures in the continuing avant-garde tradition – stress on the material of art. Mayakovsky as the ugly duckling – his suicide a search for lost youth. G.’s doubts about love of art/poetry in Russia – lots of monuments, concealing profound indifference. Still no proper editions of Tiutchev and Baratynsky. Gennady conscious of his own awkward position, Chuvash country boy in the big city. The Chuvash now live well, better than people in Moscow, and have their own culture. But he needs western contact, the world of art. His books now published in many European languages, not in Russian. Much of this said as we walk over wasteland into beautiful words with clearings and a lake where a woman is swimming; in evening a Chuvash artist friend joins us, a lot of vodka is drunk.\n\t\n\t27 September. Out to see Gena, he gives me bread and tea and shows me his Malevich collection, books, catalogues, a painting. M. very important for him and other writers. Then into the birch woods, talking about Pasternak and Mayakovsky – relation of P. to futurists and Khlebnikov, attitudes to death and immortality. For G.A., poetry has to be in touch with white hot reality (nakal), as Blok always was, whereas most Soviet poetry is trivial rhyming. G. not keen on Tsvetaeva, her ‘market-place’ shouting. We walk back over wasteland, along an old-style village street with vegetable plots, houses with carved windows, dust and neglect, old women, cows, dung-piles, and a beautiful church – all this opposite the South-West high-rise developments, a perfect contrast.\n\t\n\tAC: This is absolutely wonderful and makes me very much want to press for details on each point. But for now: would you say more about your shared interest in Pasternak. More specifically, “relation of P. to futurists and Khlebnikov” and his “attitudes to death and immortality. . ..” I particularly appreciated what you said about Aygi’s reading of Dr. Zhivago as an epic prose poem (very much how I’ve always read Proust as well, I’m embarrassed to admit, diving into him at any random point). What is your own relationship with Pasternak’s verse and how did it develop? Ironically, because of his turn away from Futurism, only My Sister – Life and the Zhivago poems are well-known in the west. Did Aygi feel any connection to Khlebnikov beside his appreciation of poetry’s use of materials, as you say (his very public form of address for example, his very personal voice, a strongly-felt connection to the people and the country, as is true for all Russian “national poets”). Also, did Aygi happen to know Kruchenykh? Finally, your shared interest in French poetry. Did that emerge on your second visit, and what French poets were YOU working on or reading at the time?\n\t\n\tPF: Pasternak: In 1974 I was embarking on a Selected Poems of Pasternak, jointly translated with Jon Stallworthy. It was eventually published in 1983, later in Penguin Books. I went to Moscow to speak to people who had known Pasternak, and Gena was one of these. He has written at length – and very movingly – about his relations with P. (a second father to him) – the text, entitled “Everyday Miracle: meetings with Boris Pasternak 1956-1958,” touches on many of the points he talked about with me. I have prepared, and hope to publish some day a volume containing this piece on Pasternak, together with others by GA on Khlebnikov, Kruchonykh, Shalamov, Kafka and many others. (See in French Guennadi Aigui, Conversations à distance, tr. Léon Robel, Circé 1994)\n\t\n\tOn death and immortality: this is reflected in Doctor Zhivago (Dr. Life) – see the conversations of the hero and his mother near the beginning, and the point where Pasternak writes that art “reflects unremittingly on death and in doing so unremittingly creates life.” A key notion for Aygi—the point of his “holy ritual” is to “preserve human warmth under the cold sky of the world”. Notions of immortality, fuelled by Einstein, were very present in Russia c. 1920, see what Roman Jakobson writes about Mayakovsky and Fedorov in “A generation that squandered its poets.”\n\t\n\tFuturists: G.A. mainly talked about the relations between Pasternak and Mayakovsky (he saw Mayakovsky in Antipov in Doctor Zhivago – Antipov/antipodes) – a much discussed subject of course. Khlebnikov was centrally important for G.A. (see for instance Child-and-Rose, p. 92). He wrote brilliantly about him in a centenary piece called “Leaves – into a Festive Wind,” also the poem “Birthday Image” (1978, in Selected Poems). For him, Khlebnikov was the great pioneer in poetic language – but he also (as for Mayakovsky) expressed from early on reservations about the “anti-human” directions taken by futurism. In his view, Malevich was free of such failings, as was Kruchonykh. He knew Kruchonykh in his later years, wrote very warmly about him (“Yes, Kruchonykh himself,”) with a brief poem for his 80th birthday (“Krch – 80” in Winter Revels).\n\t\n\tFrench poetry: we didn’t actually talk about this a lot in the early years, though he had already done his famous Chuvash-language anthology of French poetry. Baudelaire was the great figure of course, though later he talked and wrote of Pierre-Jean Jouve, Max Jacob and other poets of that time. I’ve never “worked on” modern French poetry, but the two French poets where I felt closest to him were René Char (we both took part in a BBC programme on Char’s death), and of course Gérard de Nerval – we went together in Paris to the place where Nerval killed himself.\n\t\n\tAC: Nerval? an ultimate outsider (of course totally brilliant, possessed of great energy, but also quite mad). Since you were there, please tell us the story. Why the pilgrimage, and why de Nerval? And if you might, a few more words about the reception of Gennady’s work at home, not even so much reception, but any opportunities he had to share his poetry with readers or other poets. I’m particularly interested to find out what contacts and friendships he had with poets of his own and younger generations, particularly with the Lianozovo circle and the Moscow Conceptualists.\n\t\n\tPF: Nerval was certainly a talismanic figure for Gena – I think, as often with him, it was a mixture of enthusiasm for the work and devotion to the figure and destiny of the poet. You get something similar in his relations with Pasternak, Kafka (he loved the conversations with Janoush), Norwid and others. For Nerval, it’s simply that we were in central Paris, and he guided me to the commemorative plaque by the Tour St Jacques, near where Nerval died. He had a great piety for many literary and artistic figures of the past, writing poems in their memory, but also going on pilgrimages. I accompanied him to places associated with Malevich, Pasternak, Max Jacob, Dickens and Robert Burns – in 1989 we went to Burns’s tomb in Dumfries, where he placed black earth from the grave of the great Chuvash poet Vasley Mitta – he also took me more than once to Mitta’s tomb, a moving place in the village next to his native village.\n\t\n\tAygi’s reception and Moscow literary circles: I don’t know a great deal about this, since I only went to see him in Moscow every three or four years, and he didn’t write about such things in his letters (Léon Robel’s French monograph of 1993 is very helpful on such questions). He was certainly associated with a number of groups, including the Liazonovo group, where he was taken by his great friend the composer Andrey Volkonsky I think. I don’t remember him speaking much about contemporary Russian poets, but among those he admired and sympathized with one could mention Genrich Sapgir, Yunna Morits, and particularly Vsevolod Nekrasov (and in a later generation Andrey Zhdanov). I don’t know about his relation with the Conceptualists – what I do remember is his resistance to the notion of the post-modern. When he talked about the Moscow “underground” where he found support in the hard years after 1959, he was more likely to talk of composers (such as Volkonsky and Valentin Silvestrov) or of painters (above all Vladimir Yakovlev, the leading spirit in the group round Aleksandr Vassiliev, but also Anatoly Zverev, Igor Vulokh, Grigory Gavrilenko, and the Chuvash Anatoly Mittov). Don’t forget that he worked for about 10 crucial years at the Mayakovsky Museum, where he organized path-breaking exhibitions of Russian modernist art of the period of Malevich, Goncharova, etc.\n\t\n\tSo he had a small “public” of like-minded people, but was cut off from a larger public. He wrote in 1985, “For over twenty years I had fewer than a dozen readers (I am not thinking of those who knew my poems in translation –-I did not know what they thought of my poetry)” – and he says elsewhere, “The situation was not affected by the existence of a few close friends and readers, since friends, who are moreover all involved in art and welded together by the same misfortune and the same limiting conditions, are “halves” and “parts” of one’s own self, as opposed to the intriguingly unknown world of readers which one seeks and attempts to create.” What’s more, he wasn’t a samizdat writer; apparently, only five or six people took manuscript or typed copies of his poems (though of course copies came to be made for translators, myself included).\n\t\n\tThe situation was gradually transformed by the great interest in his work abroad, the publication and translation of his poetry in other countries, at first particularly Poland, Germany and France, but by the time I published my first book of translations in 1989, he had a great network of contacts all around the world -mainly writers, translators, artists. After 1988 he was able to travel and meet his foreign audiences, and at about the same time, he was at last published and recognized (up to a point) in Russia – and particularly in Chuvashia, where he was transformed from anti-social cosmopolitan element to national poet.\n\t\n\tIt’s a paradox isn’t it, the most sociable of men being driven for 20 years into solitary (“monologic” he called it) writing.\n\t\n\tAC: Would you say more about Aygi at the Mayakovsky Museum in Moscow; you’d mentioned before that he’d been dismissed from his job there, which was an unusual thing in Soviet Russia. But how was a writer who was expelled from the Gorky Institute in 1958 for “composing a book of oppositional poems undermining the basic methods of socialist realism” able to get the position in the first place? Are you aware of what happened and the politics at the museum? And more generally, is there anything you can say about Aygi’s material conditions in the years without full-time work. We’ve heard repeatedly that writers made ends meet with translation work, etc., but I’ve never quite understood how this was possible.\n\t\n\tPF: I think G.A. got the position at the Museum (rather miraculously) through personal relations. It was a great opportunity for him (Robel calls it a second university) – while there, he worked (under the mentorship of the great scholar/critic Nikolay Khardzhiev) on exhibitions of the avant-garde artists of the early 20th C. It wasn’t all plain sailing; in 1967 the authorities prohibited a Chagall exhibition (see poems on this in Winter Revels). G.A. was dismissed in 1971 – I don’t know the exact reasons, but he had been at odds with the (new) management. There’s no doubt that between 1959 and 1985 or so he went through many black periods; there were political and personal reasons for this, but also material conditions – lack of a place to live, extreme poverty (at one point he wrote to me that he hadn’t money to buy paper). How he made ends meet I don’t really know – though I’m sure the networks of friendship helped. And I have to say that when I spent time with him in those days (which wasn’t often, it’s true) he almost always seemed resilient and cheerful.\n\t\n\tAC: There is one last aspect of Aygi’s life I was hoping you might be able to fill us in on. You’d mentioned that you “don’t use the word shaman loosely” in connection with Aygi. Is there anything you can tell us about his connection to Chuvash spiritual practices, as well as about those practices more generally. We of course know nothing about Chuvashia (as you yourself said you at first did). You mentioned, for example that they now live well. How is that possible: agriculture, natural resources? What are some of the practices they’ve been able to maintain; are they animistic?\n\t\n\tPF: As you know, G.A.’s poetry is deeply spiritual. Partly because of Kierkegaard, he came back to his own form of Christianity, and read a great deal of Christian religious writing (Church fathers, modern theologians), but he also felt a bond with the old pagan religion of the Chuvash. His maternal grandfather was a pagan priest (an ordinary peasant, not a shaman); when I was in his village we went to the cemetery and poured beer and honey on the tomb. Walking in the forests near the village he pointed out the sacred trees (kiremet). Even after some centuries of forced Christianization something of the old religion survives (the round choral dance, certain festivals) alongside Christianity and Soviet style materialism. There are movements aiming to revive paganism; Gena didn’t have much time for these.\n\t\n\tSpace and my experience are too limited for me to say anything useful about Chuvash life; let me just note that in Shaymurzino (G.A.’s village) when I’ve been there, I’ve seen plenty of farm animals and birds, and people getting on with cultivating the rich black earth. Things have changed and are changing, and G.’s remarks made in 1974 probably don’t apply now.\n\t\n\tAC: Peter, would you share with us some of your thoughts regarding Aygi’s continuing influence and legacy in Russian contemporary poetry; are there poets who consider themselves to have been influenced by him? Or is he too sui generis to have left followers. And I know we have barely scratched the surface about Aygi’s work itself, but would you say a few things, quite broadly, about what your approach had been to translating him into English? Any advice to his future translators?\n\t\n\tPF: I’m no expert on contemporary Russian poetry, Alex, but I have the impression that while Aygi is now loved and respected by many poets and poetry lovers and is in a way a modern classic, he remains fairly unknown to most readers -and is rejected by not a few. I think you’re right to suggest that he’s a very special case, and it’s difficult to imagine a “school of Aygi.\" However, he has contributed greatly to making free verse more acceptable in Russian. In Chuvashia things are different of course, he’s the “national poet” – but this rests in large part on his poetry in Chuvash, even though the Chuvash appreciate that his Russian writing has helped put Chuvashia on the map. I wouldn’t want to suggest that there’s a “right way” to translate Aygi, or any poetry for that matter. My own approach has been: a) to try to explore each new poem as a new territory in a land which is not mine, but which can speak to me (I translate in order to understand better); b) not to simplify too much, but to keep the ambiguities and uncertainties and reflect something of the strangeness of the original; c) to attempt to do some kind of justice to the rhythmic power of the original, which was very evident when Aygi read his poems. Of course I’ve been greatly helped by a long and close friendship with Gena – he could explain things, even though he didn’t speak any English, so couldn’t judge my translations except by sound.\n\t\n\tAC: I know that you’ve been laboring on Yevgeny Baratynsky and that your book is coming out next year? Is it a Selected? Why Baratynsky? And I know this will seem an odd one but: any connection between A. and B. for you personally?\n\t\n\tPF: Yes, it will be a Selected, published by Arc—a bilingual volume centered on a complete translation of Sumerki (Half-Light). I can’t really say why Baratynsky, except that the more I read him, the more I was impressed and wanted to find a voice for him in English (which is roughly what I felt when I began translating Aygi). He’s not at all like Aygi (except in a fearless seriousness) and he wasn’t one of his favorite poets (he preferred Lermontov, Batyushkov, Annensky – all of whom I’ve also being translating)\n\t\n\tAC: One last question: would you tell us about your work on the Aygi archive, and any posthumous publications. As a translator myself, I would of course like to know your opinion on what aspect of Aygi’s work you think might still require translating, your work being fairly exhaustive. And please, anything you would like to say in closing, and as a farewell to our readers?\n\t\n\tPF: Since Gena’s death a number of people have been working in Russia and Chuvashia to bring together and publish his work. The archive is somewhat scattered, especially what must be an extraordinarily rich collection of letters to people all over the world – it would be good if these could be brought together, in the Chuvash National Library for instance, but I think they’d be too numerous to be published en masse. For myself, I’ve published two volumes of his poetry since 2006, but probably shan’t do much more, and there are many poems that haven’t yet been translated, particularly from the pre-1975 work. One thing I want to do is publish A.’s tributes to writers (from Pasternak to Transtromer) which I’ve gathered together in translation.\n\t\n\tThank you, Alex, for taking me back to meetings that meant so much in my life. For me, it’s difficult to disentangle the poet from the poetry, but I hope that the poetry, even in translation, will for some readers do what Aygi wanted –“to preserve human warmth under the cold sky of the world.” \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     An Introduction for Fifteen Iraqi Poets\n  \n  \n    The New Directions Poetry and Prose Subscription \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

This introduction appears in the book as a prefatory note.\n\n\t* * *\n\n\tAs I was putting together this mini-anthology, I learned something very exciting about the history of Iraqi poetry. But before I share my little discovery, I want to emphasize that what I learned relates not only to these fifteen poems but to the many other poems I read in making this slim selection. It was a nearly impossible task trying to pick only fifteen grains of sand from a shimmering desert. There is a saying in my country that if you throw a stone in Iraq, it will likely fall onto the head of a poet! In his poem “Nothing but Iraq,” Mahmoud Darwish writes, “For poetry is always being born in Iraq, so become Iraqi to become a poet, my friend.” Beginning in the 1940s, when the free-verse movement started in my homeland and gradually spread to other Arab countries, a major topic of discussion in the Arab literary world has been the “legality” or “illegality” of breaking the rules of classical poetry known as a’muudi. The metrical rules of a’muudi were set by Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi in the eighth century. Al-Farahidi established sixteen meters of verse for poets to follow, each rhythmic pattern — called bahr or “sea” — included a hemistich in each line as well as end rhymes. Today, the free verse of Arabic poetry still makes use of rhyme, while the poetic line is open to more rhythmic flexibility without the hemistich and varies in length. The prose poem in Arabic has completely broken with classical forms. Writers of prose poetry have defended their work against accusations that “this is not poetry,” saying their poems contain a more organic “inner rhythm.”\n\n\tWhat I discovered as I read more and more poems is that modern Iraqi poetry is a natural continuation of Sumerian poetry, and that classical a’muudi verse is in fact a tradition that branched from the river of Iraqi poetry. The words from Sumer in southern Iraq were our first cries of poetry, etched in a cuneiform script onto clay tablets, the lines unfolding in one long prose poem without rhymes but with an “inner rhythm.” The texts are shaped by a narrative, but the repetition of lines and the intensity of images are unmistakably lyrical. Most of the narratives are broken into fragments, though it is often impossible to discern if the fragmentation is intentional or due to missing or crumbling tablets. Sumerian poetry is inherently metaphorical, its metaphors naturally surfacing from primitive images and symbols used to convey complex ideas. The language lost some of its original metaphorical vividness as it evolved into Akkadian and other Semitic equivalents. In modern times the rediscovery of the writings of Sumer only dates back to the mid-nineteenth century.\n\n\tFeatures of Sumerian poetry reappear in the DNA of modern and contemporary Iraqi poetry. Its myths and symbols apparent in the writings of the pioneering poets Badr Shakir al-Sayyab and Abdul Wahab al-Bayati, and these codes became indicators of modernity. Living in a state of continuous wars and massacres, Iraqi poets have often lamented the destruction of their country with a common opening plea: “O Iraq.” This longing directed to ruined cities was very common in Sumerian poetry. For instance, such pleas in one text titled “Lamentation on the Destruction of Ur” is directed sometimes to the place without naming it (“O my city,” “O my house”) and other times to named cities (“O Nippur,” “O Isin,” “O Eridu,” “O Uruk”). The “Lamentation” consists of eleven songs totaling 436 lines, the fifth and sixth songs describing the destruction of Ur as a “devastating storm.” Delving into our recent collective memory, one recalls that the First Gulf War was code-named Operation Desert Storm by the U.S. government. Both usages of “storm” were figurative as war was the real cause of destruction in both cases. The eleventh song is a prayer to Nanna to restore the Sumerian people to their homeland, Ur.\n\n\tTo feel threatened by the new forms of modern poetry was easier than bringing the dead back to life. The oral culture of Arab society contributed to the popularity of a’muudi poetry, which spread through recitation (ilqa’) rather than through reading. Many of the poets were illiterate and the strict meters carried their verses along. Some a’muudi lyrics are filled with playful rhythms and powerful images that, when chanted or sung, make listeners’ heads sway with the feeling of tarab (“pleasing to the ear”). The phenomenal singer Um Kalthoum popularized many of these tunes, as well as the poets of her generation who penned them. A’muudi poetry is also closer to the Quran musically, making it more familiar to Arab ears. The codes of the Sumerian poetic tradition were totally unfamiliar to modern-day Iraqis, even after they became readable. The pioneers and innovators of our new poetry were perhaps more influenced by the poetry of the Americas than by Sumerian poetry, but their fruits have the unmistakable taste of the Sumerian tree. \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Forrest Gander on Eiko & Koma\n  \n  \n    Poets in Discussion: Alex Cigale Interviews Peter France, Translator of Gennady Aygi \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

The time that has directed you all your life so that you wake just before your alarm goes off and you know the feel of how long it takes to get from home to office, that given, your internal clock, it isn’t given. You realize it’s not given when you watch Eiko & Koma because you are suspended in their time which is geological and then, inside their time, you find time to become more than yourself. You are lifting your right wrist when Koma lifts his wrist, you are inhaling as Eiko’s ribcage expands. Your body has been ensorcelled and recruited, no, it has entered into a communion with those who move so slowly on stage, whose bodies shift and lose their recognizably mammalian contours and come, lente, lente, to resemble something you never imagined.\n\n\tYears ago, I sent Eiko & Koma a letter. So when the Walker Art Museum was putting together a comprehensive monograph of their work, the 320-page Eiko & Koma: Time is Not Even, Space is Not Empty, Eiko contacted me and asked if I would write for it.\n\n\tFor two years I followed them, taking notes as they developed new work, interviewing them between rehearsals, watching them perform in New York, Durham, Minneapolis, Providence. In Minneapolis, where they accepted a long residency at the Walker, I stayed all day for several days in a row. At one point, Koma called me into the performance and had me touch his shoulder and then Eiko’s shoulder. (I had told him once that I could tell more about a person by touching them on the shoulder than by talking to them for two hours. In my suddenly cumbersome clothes, holding my palm to their bare flesh while an audience watched, I could tell nothing but that I was extremely nervous.)\n\n\tThere was a woman who also showed up all week and watched, like me, for hours in the dark. Later I learned that her son was in a coma, that she spent her non-working hours in the hospital with him. The rest of her time, she watched Eiko & Koma in “Naked.” On stage, Eiko and Koma remained separated by a heap of burned feathers and scorched earth. They seemed to be trying to find each other, like two blind pupae, stretching, lifting their heads at different moments, almost making contact, then falling away. The liminal zone they created became, for the woman who sat with me, whose son was just beyond her reach, a powerful metaphor. For others, the experience generated other metaphors.\n\n\tI came to write a series of poems based on specific performances that I’ve witnessed over a span of twenty years. Not description, but enactment in another medium.\n\n\t* * *\n\n\tExcerpt from \"Naked\"\n\tForrest Gander’s Eiko & Koma, a series of poems regarding their work, is out now as a New Directions Poetry Pamphlet.\n\tPhoto Credit  © Anna Lee Campbell \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     PW on ‘Collected Poems of Denise Levertov’\n  \n  \n    An Introduction for Fifteen Iraqi Poets \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Using various exposure techniques, Frame exposes dark, shadowy glmpses of people that initially arouse feelings of suspicion only to transcend, upon closer view, into something both intimate and sinister. Frame, who has been an active photographer since the 1970s, will have a new show of work, \"Dialogue With Bolaño,\" opening at the Gitterman Gallery on November 6. The opening, which goes from 6-8 pm, is free and open to the public. \n\n\tTo celebrate the opening of \"Dialogue With Bolaño,\" we asked Frame some questions about his work on the Bolaño books, his camera technique, and backstories to a couple of his photographs.\n\n\t*   *   * \n\n\tNew Directions: How did you come to start working with New Directions on the Bolaño covers?\n\n\tAllen Frame: Barbara Epler, the publisher, knows my work well and was familiar with my book Detour, which was published in 2001. Many of the cover images appear there.\n\n\t\n\n\tND: Can you talk a bit about the body of work in Detour? How did you choose your subjects?\n\n\tAF: The photographs in Detour were taken between 1993 and 2001, except for one photograph from 1984. They are almost all photos of people I know, usually that I know well. I grew up in Mississippi and have lived in New York, London, and Florence, and I have taught photo workshops in Mexico and Russia. When I travel, it’s usually to see friends or to teach. In those travels, I photograph people that I already know, except for the occasional picture of strangers in public space. I don’t photograph diaristically, though. I’m selective about the people I photograph; although the situations spring organically from my life, still I choose certain people because of what I feel about them, or project onto them, or the way they look. There’s an element of “casting” as I fulfill a subtextual agenda of continuing an implicit but subtle narrative.\n\n\tND: You’ve recently switched from black & white to color photography. What’s the change been like for you?\n\n\tAF: I started working in color at the beginning of my career in the ’70s and photographed both in black and white and color until the early ’90s. I then started photographing exclusively in black and white because I was shooting in low-light situations with high-speed film and it seemed more apropos to work with black and white in these dark situations. I changed to color and a medium format around 2006. I was in Mexico and the color and light were so vibrant that I just couldn’t keep ignoring them, and now I photograph almost entirely in color.\n\n\t\n\n\tND: Your upcoming exhibition at the Gitterman Gallery is called \"Dialogue With Bolaño.\" What photographs will you be showing? How has Bolaño inspired your newest work?\n\n\tAF: Most of the cover images were taken before I even knew Bolaño’s work. The “dialogue” is a coincidental overlapping of interests and atmosphere, and I am thrilled by the association since he is now my favorite writer. I don’t work commercially,  so this is a kind of rare commercial experience for me, having these cover images, and I am very happy when friends discover that the image on the book they’re reading is mine. When I started reading Bolaño in the last decade, I was overcome by finding a literary voice of my generation that I could identify with so strongly. I’m a huge fan of his work, and I usually read something by him when I travel. I read both The Savage Detectives and 2666 while in Mexico. I was there this summer and reading Woes of the True Policeman. Maybe the biggest way he’s influenced me is to send me back to my archive and make me want to explore early work I did in Mississippi in the ’70s. Also, there’s a self-portrait in the exhibition that I did this summer in a Mexico City hotel room that I feel was partly inspired by his work.\n\n\t    \n\n\tND: Out of the photos now being used a Bolaño jacket, which one has the most memorable backstory?\n\n\tAF: Barbara asked me for a macabre photo for The Return, a really scary photo for some of his most extreme stories, including one about necrophilia. I gave her this portrait of Napoleon Seyfarth, a German writer, standing in his S/M dungeon in Berlin. I never thought she would use it. I took the picture in 1999, and he died a year later. The picture for Amulet looks like a woman with a revolver, but in fact she has a plate in her hand and is setting the table. I was having dinner with my friend Ariadna in Barcelona while her mother was suffering from cancer in the next room. It’s a good instance of how one’s unconscious transforms the situation without any posing or staging. I prefer this kind of accident to overt direction of the subjects. \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     R.I.P.

No one stirred. When it was over, Reed rapped the podium once with his knuckles, having completed an extraordinary tribute.\n\n\tBut he wasn’t done—a few months later, Reed offered New Directions a poetic preface to accompany our new edition of In Dreams Begin Responsibilites. Before NYC and the Velvet Undergound, while still studying at Syracuse, Reed had been Schwartz’s student. As he said in a lyric some years later, Scwhartz was \"the first great man [he] ever met.\"\n\n\t\n\t\tO Delmore how I miss you. You inspired me to write. You were the greatest man I ever met. You could capture the deepest emotions in the simplest language. Your titles were more than enough to raise the muse of fire on my neck. You were a genius. Doomed. ... I’d given him a short story. He gave me a B. I was so hurt and ashamed. Why haunt talentless me.\n\n\n\tDespite the less than stellar grade, Schwartz took Reed under his wing and into his confidence, inviting him to various literary events or bars where, over rounds of sctoch, they would lambast each song and lyric pouring out of the juke box. When Reed graduated from Syracuse, one great talent was about to soar while another retreated. During the spring of ’66, when the Velvet Underground was recording its debut album, Schwartz had isolated himself in a hotel room and cut off almost all human contact. He died later that summer. Reed dedicated \"European Son,\" the last track on The Velvet Underground and Nico, to his former mentor.\n\n\tYears later, The Velvet Underground already a legend, with the grand Transformer and the more experimental Metal Machine Music under his belt, Reed would come back to a more stripped-down style in Blue Mask (1982), which included another touching tribute to Schwartz, \"My House.\" \n\n\t\n\t\tDelmore, I missed all your funny ways\n\t\tI missed your jokes and the brilliant things you said\n\t\tMy Dedalus to your Bloom, was such a perfect wit\n\t\tand to find you in my house makes things perfect\n\t\n\t\tI really got a lucky life\n\t\tmy writing, my motorcycle and my wife\n\t\tAnd to top it all off a spirit of pure poetry\n\t\tis living in this stone and wood house with me\n\n\n\tAdmiration is a chain. Those we admire, in turn, admire others, and it is the longing to be accepted and praised by those we hold in the highest esteem that drives us to achieve for ourselves. Lou Reed’s lasting influence and admiration can be summed up in Brian Eno’s famous observation that \"although The Velvet Underground’s debut may have sold only a few thousand copies, everyone who bought it started a band.\"  One wonders, however, if Lou Reed, for all his accomplishments and accolades, for the gifts of melody and lyric to which we tap a foot or sing along, had always wanted perhaps to show his old professor this his instict had been right: that he would have made Delmore proud. We’d like to think this as we mourn the loss of Lou Reed.\n\n\tRead Lou Reed’s preface to \"In Dreams Begin Responsibilites\" here.\n\n\tListen to Lou Reed’s reading of \"In Dreams Begin Responsibilites\" here. \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     LARB on the Work of César Aira\n  \n  \n    Five Questions for Photographer Allen Frame \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Though it is only the second work we’ve brought out, it brings together the only other surviving manuscript of Rosales’ work. The Cuban journalist and novelist, Norberto Fuentes, provided this edition with the following introduction.\n\n\t*   *   *\n\n\tThe author of the two books that make up Leapfrog & Other Stories did everything he could so that none of this would make it into the reader’s hands. His favorite method was fire. I know of at least two great novels and an epic poem totalling over one hundred pages that he threw into the flames. I think it was, above all, an act of courage and not of madness. And I don’t think there’s anyone else in the world, beside his sister Leyma, who can speak with authority about Guillermo. After having written the last word of each creation, he seemed to give them a certain life span, and if in a given period of time his editor (or anyone else) didn’t show any interest, then he condemned them, without hesitation, to the flames. It could also have been a reflection of the visceral disdain he felt for the world around him. Destruction at the end of the torturous path to creation seemed a relief to him. But no one knows about the books I am referring to because no one read them. I had had before me the novel Socrates and his epic poem The Hero of Yaguajay, about Commander Camilo Cienfuegos (I can still hear his evil, mocking laughter when he said, \"If they only knew I’m doing an imitation of Quasimodo!\"). And I had read his novel about the origins of Cuban rum and the wars of independence, with that amusing episode about General Shafter’s landing on Daiquiri Beach, to the east of Santiago de Cuba. And I’d read the story, \"Colonel, it’s Puny Speaking,\" and another novel no one talks about but that concerns a battle against Batista on an imaginary mountain on the Sierra Maestra—La Taguara—with Camilo Cienfuegos again as the main character. I can’t believe none of them exist now. Worse still, these stunning and unique literary works did exist and not even their ashes remain. Can you imagine what American literature would be without a Poe or a Wolfe, or French literature without Baudelaire or Camus, or Russian literature without Artsybashev or Akhmatova, just to name the most secretive and hidden writers? Well, then we Cubans have to accept our own national literature without Guillermo Rosales.\n\t\n\tOur friendship began on his first day of work as a journalist for the magazine, Mella, in the summer of 1961. He was 15 years old and hadn’t read Hemingway, much less Faulkner, but he gave me a run for my money with his encyclopedic knowledge of the great Will Eisner’s The Spirit. It was our shared culture as Cuban kids who grew up in the 1950s. This is tangible on the pages of Leapfrog, a book written by Guillermo very early in the 1960s and which he ended up naming very differently from how we first knew it in its initial Spanish edition. It was originally called Holy Saturday, Resurrection Sunday. It escaped the bonfire because Delia, his loving mother, went around picking up the pieces of paper and wrinkled sheets that her son left lying around as he was writing. The stories in The Magic Still have a different history. Guillermo was already living in Miami when he sent them to a friend in Washington so she could organize them and make a clean copy. In the editing process, Rosa Berra, the friend he’d known since the 1960s in Havana, made a digital transcription (computers were beginning to take over the market) and that is how the book was saved. We can assume that in 1993, when Guillermo made the decision to destroy himself, he wasn’t going to leave his unpublished books at the mercy of unknown hands rummaging about.* So he proceeded, with as much disdain as meticulousness, to burn the thick bundle of his novel about rum and Cuba’s liberators and any papers he had left in his drawers. Later, he put the barrel of a gun to his temple, metal that was cold to the touch. A Cuban exile community which doesn’t understand him and which distorts him (and in the end, can’t stand him) has yielded few readers. Perhaps he did well to throw it all to the flames.\n\n\t— Norberto Fuentes\n\n\t*He committed suicide on July 9, 1993 \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     A Preview of Dickinson's Envelope Poems on Bookforum\n  \n  \n    The Coffin Factory Praises “Seiobo There Below” \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

I hope they will loosen up.”\n\n        \n\n      One hundred years ago today, on October 30, 1914, James Laughlin—poet, heir to a steel fortune, and the founder of New Directions—was born. The story of New Directions begins when young Laughlin asked Ezra Pound for career advice. Pound told him to give up on poetry and \"do something useful\" instead. Laughlin founded New Directions in 1936. \n\nQuietly, he continued to write. Charles Simic writes of Laughlin’s poetry: \"The secret is out, the publisher of Williams and Pound is himself a great lyric poet.\" Next month, New Directions will publish The Collected Poems of James Laughlin edited by Peter Glassgold. \n\nWhen Laughlin passed away in his eighty-third year, his \"auto-bugg-offery\" was unfinished. Instead, we have The Way It Wasn’t, a beautiful and funny book of ephemera compiled by New Directions publisher Barbara Epler and Laughlin’s son-in-law Daniel Javitch. Next month Literchoor is my Beat: A Life of James Laughlin, Publisher of New Directions by Ian MacNiven will be published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux. \n\nTo celebrate the life and poetry of James Laughlin we share notes, quotes, and poems.\n\nInside the cover of every new New Directions title is the tribute: New Directions books are published for James Laughlin. \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note to Peggy Fox, former President and Publisher of ND. \n\n\n\n\"Two old geezers riding in a golf cart... talking about Homer.\"\n\nJL and Robert Fitzergald.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The world is full of irritating people.\"—JL\n\n\n\nJL and Gary Snyder                       \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     100 years of Dylan Thomas: a look through the New Directions archive\n  \n  \n    Peter Cole and Susan Howe at McNally Jackson \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

By 7:30 pm, the line for the event stretched down the Bowery a full block. Those at the front were ushered into a small gallery with a platform stage. On the stage were a microphone, a stand, and a small table with three sculptural bottles of water. The room quickly filled out. The overspill watched the event projected on a white wall in a side gallery. \n\nKiki Smith gave a short introduction, in which she quoted Georges Bataille: \"Every animal is in the world like water in water,\" a line she says she returns to when thinking about poetry (and the line resurfaced later, reinforcing its glimmer, in Berssenbrugge’s \"Immortals Having a Party\").\n\nAfter the reading, a friend spotted Anne Carson outside the gallery and confessed to having read her poetry pamphlet The Albertine Workout aloud many times. Carson replied, \"The numbers are the best part.\" And was gone. \n\nThank you to The Hole and Future Feminism for putting together such a great event.

He raises his hand to his mouth, twisting the curved ends of his grey moustache upwards. He makes sure that his fez tilts slightly to the left. He removes the black, burnt-out cigarette from the corner of his mouth. Brushes off ash that has dropped on to the front of his thick black overcoat. He wipes his face to smooth the wrinkles in his forehead and forces a smile across his lips. He grabs hold of my left hand. We feel our way forward in the light of the sunset.\n\n\tWe head towards the right, the only way out of our alley, picking our way to the winding main street with its crowds of people and shops. At the market, Hajj Abdel ’Alim, the sheikh of the quarter, calls to us from his shop: “Please, stop in for a while, Khalil Bey.”\n\n\tMy father answers him quietly: “We’ll pass by on our way back.”\n\n\tThe chemist. His shop is clean and gives off a smell of phenol. A glass bowl is piled high with chocolates and sweets. I pull my father’s hand towards it and he scolds me.\n\n\tThe shoe shop. A shoeshine man sits at the bottom of a raised chair. A newspaper rack stands in front and a huge radio at the back.\n\n\tThe fez press. It has a long brass base and a big brass molding on top.\n\n\tThen finally, the square.\n\n\t\n\n\t \n\n\tIts light is pale in the first few minutes of evening. The picture of the king is lit by lamps. Posters congratulate him on his birthday. Billboards for cinemas. The film Hassan the Brave is playing in living color. The Black Knight is playing at Cinema Miami, with Arabic subtitles. I feel a cool breeze slapping at my bare knees between the bottoms of my shorts and the tops of my long woolen socks. My left hand feels warm in my father’s strong grip. Tram number 22 with its open cars and wooden benches. I race beside the tramcar with the children running along its left side. I jump on it at the last second to show we can escape the ticket collector, almost falling underneath its rows of metal wheels.\n\n\tWe board the second car, and he squeezes me down in the corner so I’ll look younger than I am. He pulls eight millimes out of his breast pocket for the ticket. We get off at Sayyida Square, flooded with lights. The Swaris bus is pulled by two skinny mules. Its passengers fill out its benches facing each other and spilling on to its back steps. The driver’s whip lashes across the backs of the two animals. An old, fat woman squats on the floor around a tray of cigarette butts. In a cramped space at the end there is a small desk behind a glass partition. An old, hunchbacked man with a thick beard. My father takes his round pocket watch out of his breast pocket. The old man eyes it carefully until he puts it aside and puts down his money.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\tAgain, the busy street. The lottery seller hangs his tickets on the wall. My father takes out two tickets and his reading glasses. He compares his numbers to the register of the seller. He tears up the two tickets and throws them aside. He buys two new tickets, a red one and a blue one.\n\n\tA row of hawkers selling used goods, and shoeshiners. A stack of old eyeglasses on a newspaper on the ground. The salesman wears prescription glasses with a broken bridge in the middle, soldered together with a big piece of tin. My father bends over and shuffles through the glasses. He chooses one and asks me to try them on. I put the glasses over my eyes and look around. I try another pair. A third pair has thin, oval frames made from gilded metal. I can tell that my vision is better now. Father haggles for a while over the price then buys them.\n\n\tI put the glasses on and follow father to the spice shop. He buys cinnamon, crushed black pepper, and cloves. I can see clearly now.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\tAgain, we take the tram with the open car. We go to the back and ride the covered car at the end with the single bench facing backwards. We shoot like an arrow past the empty stations that no riders have asked for. Sparks flick off the contact pole. I put my hand over my glasses, scared that they might fly off. We rumble slowly into Al-Zahir Square. The open- air Cinema Valery has closed for winter. My mother is in a colored dress. Her head is covered by a silk sash that wraps around her face. Her shoes are blue and white. They have a medium high heel and closed toe. She sits in a chair with wicker arms. I try to sit on her lap but she pushes me away. My father takes me between his knees. A hawker passes by wearing a clean gallabiya and carrying a basket covered with a cloth. My father buys each of us a sameet, a pretzel with sesame seeds. The hawker gives us each a slice of Egyptian Romano cheese in a bite- sized wrapper.\n\n\tThe covered car rocks back and forth. My father pulls me to him to protect me from the cold wind. I shrink into his hug. His odor of stale tobacco swallows me. I fight off drowsiness. I feel an urge to get up and turn the brake arm, just to see what happens to the wheel on the tracks. I wish I could be in bed already. I am on a mat stretched over a rug in the guest room next to the servant woman. The room is dark and the door is cracked open just enough to see through to the hall. There is a ray of light from the electric lamp in the dining room. The servant sings along with the radio: “Oh, your coal black eyes . . .” Her soft voice whispers next to my ear. Her hand plays with my hair and touches my head. She finishes the song and tells me the story of Hassan the Brave. In the darkness, the seats turn into mountains, stallions, and castles. Hassan the Brave suckles at the breast of a ghoul, who says to him: “You took a little milk from my right breast and became like my child Sama’ain, and you took a little milk from my left breast and became like my child Soleiman.”\n\n\t--- \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     New Directions at PEN World Voices Festival\n  \n  \n    “Stealth” Book Trailer \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

One of Germany’s rising literary stars, Erpenbeck was born in East Berlin in 1967. Her grandfather, grandmother, and father were all published writers in a variety of genres, while her mother was a translator. She has worked on opera and musical productions in Berlin and Graz since 1991, and is now a freelance writer and producer living near Graz. Erpenbeck’s fiction includes the much-lauded novel The Old Child and the short story collection The Book of Words. Most recently she has published the wonderfully evocative novel Visitation. Erpenbeck’s often surreal and always enigmatic fiction has now been translated into 14 languages.The event will be moderated by Erpenbeck’s English-language translator, Susan Bernofsky, an expert on German literature and culture as well as on the theory and practice of literary translation. Bernofsky teaches literary translation in the MFA Writing Program at the Columbia University School of the Arts and blogs about literary translation at www.translationista.org.\n\n\tWhen:  6:00 pm to 7:30 pm on Thursday, April 3, 2014\n\tLocation:  Barristers Hall, Boston University Law School, 765 Commonwealth Avenue\n\n\t \n\n\t \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     The Bibliography Is the Medium\n  \n  \n    April Events \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Knopf.\n\n\t*  *  *\n\n\tNourish Beginnings\n\tTen Notes on Muriel Rukeyser’s Elegies\n\n\ti.\n\n\tWritten over a decade of war — the Spanish Civil War, World War II, the beginnings of the Cold War—Muriel Rukeyser’s Elegies capture the spirit, the anguish, and the desperate hopes of that daunting, world-changing time. The elegies, as they were written, appeared in three of Rukeyser’s collections: the first five in A Turning Wind (1939), the next four in Beast in View (1944), and the tenth and final elegy in The Green Wave (1948). In 1949, under the discerning stewardship of James Laughlin, New Directions was the first to bring them all together, in a handsome limited edition hand-signed and numbered in the poet’s distinctive peacock-blue ink. Now, more than half a century later, here they are again together, in all their power, the full sweep of their ambition and achievement. They are no less relevant in our era of permanent war.\n\n\tThese poems, though rooted in key events of the decade in which they were written, are not reportage, not agitprop, not antiwar sloganeering. Rather, they are a profound poetic meditation on the sources of violence and love in our lives, and mark out the intersections — Rukeyser called these “meeting-places” — where such conflicting desires create new possibilities. In a world of upheaval, when survival seems the only course, these are poems of transformation.\n\n\tii.\n\n\tIn the summer of 1936, the twenty-two-year-old author of a groundbreaking first book, Theory of Flight, was asked by the London cultural journal Life and Letters Today to cover the People’s Olympiad in Barcelona, the antifacist alternative to the official Olympics in Berlin. Just past the town of Moncada, fifteen miles from Barcelona, Muriel Rukeyser’s train ground to a halt amid shooting. Instead of arriving for the opening of the peaceful games, she found herself thrown into the first fighting of the Spanish Civil War.\n\n\tAlso on the train was an earnest young man from Germany named Otto Boch, a carpenter by trade but also a runner, on his way to Barcelona to compete in the Olympiad. Surrounded by the cruel soundtrack of gunfire and sirens, as Franco set his forces against the people of Spain, these two young people became lovers. Together they witnessed the beginnings of the Fascist will to power in Europe, and they recognized that they must take action. Boch remained to fight for the Republican cause. Five days later, Rukeyser was evacuated with other refugees, and returned to New York, where she worked for the American Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy. Boch’s letters to her ceased to arrive after 1938; still, she held out hope that he had not perished.\n\n\tRukeyser was later to call her five days in Spain a \"stroke of insight,” the moment when she understood creative responsibility. “Then I began to say what I believe,” she wrote in her introduction to The Life of Poetry.\n\n\tiii.\n\n\tRilke’s famous Duino Elegies, also a cycle of ten poems, appeared in the U. S. in a new translation by Stephen Spender and J. B. Leishman in 1939. Rukeyser, who read German, was already deeply familiar with them — they were a key inspiration for her work.\n\n\tRilke began his elegies in 1912, two years before Gavrila Prinzip’s bullet toppled the tenuous order of Europe, though they wouldn’t be completed until a decade later. “Prinzip’s year bore us,” Rukeyser wrote of her generation in “Poem Out of Childhood,” “see us turning at breast / quietly while the air throbs over Sarajevo.” In Trieste, the cosmopolitan port city of the Austrian Empire near Duino Castle, where Rilke was staying, the last pre-dreadnought battleships were being constructed and christened for a war that was sure to come.\n\n\t\n\t\tWho, if I cried, would hear me among the angelic orders?\n\t\n\t\t*\n\t\n\t\tStrange, not to go on wishing one’s wishes. Strange, to see all that was once relation so loosely fluttering hither and thither in space.\n\t\n\t\t— Rilke, First Elegy\n\n\n\tRukeyser began her elegies in New York in 1939, still hoping for word from her beloved in Spain. Barcelona and Madrid had already fallen, and it was likely Boch had fallen, too. Then Russia and Germany signed the devastating pact that spelled doom for Europe. From the window of her parents’ apartment, she could see the Navy’s new aircraft carriers and destroyers being launched on the Hudson River. As she had gone down to that river many times in her youth, now she goes down to “Rotten Lake,” as she titled her first elegy, to discover\n\n\t\n\t\twhat must be crossed and cut out of your heart,\n\t\twhat must be stood beside and straightly seen.\n\t\n\t\t*\n\t\n\t\tDare it arrive, the day when weakness ends?\n\t\tWhen the insistence is strong, the wish converted?\n\t\tI prophesy the meeting by the water\n\t\t            of these desires.\n\t\n\t\t— First Elegy. Rotten Lake\n\n\n\tiv.\n\n\tMeanings, Rukeyser held, were the first casualties of war; the search for meanings would always be deferred till “afterward,” when it was too late, and the meanings were lost. The Elegies do not wait.\n\n\tv.\n\n\tTo see, without sentimentality, without self-pity, but with full self-knowledge—that is the goal of these elegies, as it was the goal of Rilke’s: to imagine a way of being, a new unity. Living in “the scraps of an age whose choice is seen / to lie between evils,” Rukeyser imagines a new kind of action:\n\n\t\n\t\tNew combinations set out materials now,\n\t\tcombine them again! the existence is the test.\n\t\n\t\t*\n\t\n\t\tA man is walking, wearing the world, swearing\n\t\tsaying You damn fools come out into the open.\n\t\tWhose dislocated wish? Whose terrors whine?\n\t\tI’ll fuse him straight.\n\t\tThe useable present starts my calendar.\n\t\t  \n\t\t— Third Elegy. The Fear of Form\n\n\n\tvi.\n\n\tRukeyser has been called “difficult,” she has been called “vague.” Louise Bogan, never a friend to Rukeyser, called the Elegies “incoherent.” But in demanding that creation, and the process of creation, be made visible on the page, Rukeyser is a pioneer of at least two generative practices in American poetry. In her perceptive early study The Poetic Vision of Muriel Rukeyser (1980), Louise Kertesz points out that Rukeyser anticipated Charles Olson and Robert Duncan’s proposals of the poem as a field of energy. Rukeyser writes in The Life of Poetry in 1949:\n\n\t\n\t\tExchange is creation.\n\t\n\t\tIn poetry, the exchange is one of energy. Human energy is transferred, and from the poem it reaches the reader. Human energy, which is consciousness, the capacity to produce change in existing conditions.\n\n\n\tAnd this is Olson a year later in his essay “Projective Verse”:\n\n\t\n\t\tA poem is energy transferred from where the poet got it . . . by way of the poem itself, all the way over, to the reader . . . the poem itself must, at all points, be a high energy-construct, and at all points, an energy-discharge... And it involves a whole series of new recognitions.\n\n\n\tMoreover, in the Elegies, Rukeyser continues and extends her fractal amplifications of micro and macro, of the American landscape and the American character, first explored in her documentary modernist classic “Book of the Dead.” In the “Fifth Elegy. A Turning Wind,” Rukeyser brings to the page what we now recognize as a radical ecopoetics. The poem is an ideal, if complex, expression of her famous quote from 1972: “It isn’t that one brings life together — it’s that one will not allow it to be torn apart.”\n\n\tvii.\n\n\tAn unfolding exploration of the meeting-places between contradictory desires — welcome frictions and expansions creating new definitions of peace: let’s ask ourselves why the Elegies (not to mention Rukeyser’s “Letter to the Front”) do not appear in recent anthologies of World War II poetry, such as Poets of World War II (Library of America, 2004), American War Poetry (Columbia University Press, 2006), or The Poetry of War (Cambridge University Press, 2008).\n\n\tAs Rukeyser would ask, What resource are we not using?\n\n\tviii.\n\n\t“You’ve achieved a kind of tragic optimism that most of us are still trying to define,” the poet and critic John Malcolm Brinnin wrote to her.\n\n\tix.\n\n\t\n\t\tNourish beginnings, let us nourish beginnings.\n\t\tNot all things are blest, but the\n\t\tseeds of all things are blest.\n\t\tThe blessing is in the seed.\n\t\n\t\t— Tenth Elegy. Elegy in Joy\n\n\n\tRukeyser’s son William Laurie had just been born when she wrote her last elegy.\n\n\t“Nourish beginnings,” something women tend to be good at. And being a woman, being a mother, being busy breast-feeding and writing about it, she walked, or was walked, stroller-pushing, out of the carefully sentried canon. Maybe it is this way she became, in Anne Sexton’s words, “the mother of us all.”\n\n\tx.\n\n\tOtto Bloch lost his life in battle at the Ebro River on April 11, 1938. Rukeyser received confirmation more than five years later, on Christmas Eve 1943, from Ernst Toller. “He was cut down, with 300 out of 700,” Rukeyser noted in her journal that evening. She continues: “I still love what I have always loved . . . I believe in faith and resistance. Not: faith, meaning belief in that which is against natural processes, but an extension, the conclusion to which the images led me.” In 1949, she dedicated the Elegies to Otto Bloch.\n\n\t— Jan Heller levi & Christoph Keller\n\t  \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Numéro Cinq on All Things Borges\n  \n  \n    The City Lights Blog on Lispector’s ‘Selected Cronicas’ \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

This one is a bit longer, and comes from a chapter entitled \"How to Have Fun with a Fat Man,\" which is about a third of the way into the book. That’s all the context you’ll need.\n\n\tRidgway will also be making a pair of appearances in New York (sorry, we like him so much we’re keeping him to ourselves) in the next week. First at the Brooklyn Book Festival — Sunday, September 22, 4pm on the North Stage — and then at McNally Jackson Books — Monday, September 23, 7pm. \n\n\t\n\t\tHe pulls the strap on his helmet. He adjusts the grip on his shield.\n\t\n\t\tHe opens the towel around his waist and pulls it a little tighter and ties it again, tucking one edge of it under another, breathing in, his shoulders lifting and falling against the wall.\n\t\n\t\tThere is a man he wants nothing to do with. There are things he doesn’t want to do. He manoeuvres to avoid. He aligns his body just so. He exerts pressure in a different direction. The music. And with it, out of mouths all around him, noises prior to language. Movement from before language. Everything here is before language. How can his mind help him with that?\n\t\n\t\tHe feels a hand on him. He doesn’t know how it’s connected. He feels a face next to his. He doesn’t know whether the hand and the face are linked, how to see them, how to know if what he wants is anything to do with it any more. He pushes. He pushes harder. There is another hand on him, or maybe it is the same hand.\n\t\n\t\tA voice crackles in his earpiece and they hold a line. There is a smell of sweat and the heat shimmers above the bodies in front of him and they swirl like they are simmering, cooking, about to boil, and the man beside him shouts something that Hawthorn can make no sense of but for its excited anger and its eagerness, and he feels his heart thumping and is surprised and immediately not surprised to find that he has an erection.\n\t\n\t\tHe feels a mouth on him. He thinks it is a mouth. In the soft dark his cock is being sucked by someone he cannot see. He tries to decipher shapes. Hands are on him. He doesn’t know whose hands. He closes his eyes. There is a shape by his shape, a high sweet smell, a cock pressing against his thigh. He takes the cock in his hand. He cannot see anything. He opens his eyes. There are shapes and sounds. He tries to see shapes behind the sounds. No one uses language. He cannot see the fat man. He pulls his hips back gently, puts his hand on the head that is sucking him, makes it stop. It is doing it too well. There is too much to do. He sinks to his knees to see what will happen. He is presented with two cocks, and he sucks one and holds the other. He moans and the darkness tumbles around him and he moves his hands above his head. There are flat bodies. He closes his eyes. He is swimming in the river and the river is on his skin. He is partaking of a comfort that predates anything his mind might think about it.\n\t\t    He feels a hand on his cock somehow. He smiles towards a laugh, and has to pause his sucking. His pause is taken for something else, and the cock in front of his mouth disappears and is replaced by its obverse and the cock to his left becomes a pair of helping hands and he is back on the riverbank with the scent of the earth and the rough close clamp of the soil, and he declines, in this dark, just now, amongst strangers, and he stands up grinning.\n\t\n\t\tThe crowd surges and they hold the line. Faces are roaring at him. At him personally. Some of the faces are the sort of thing he expects. Others seem too young and fresh for this. Or too old and smart. Too cunning. He can feel the pressure on his shield, and it all comes through his hands. He adjusts his feet to lean forward, to take some of the strain off his arms. It brings his face closer to their faces. They can’t see his face though. They see his helmet and his chin strap and his neck guard and his eyes. They all look him in the eye. Every face he turns to seeks out his eyes. He blinks.\n\t\t     There is a roar to his left, localized, and the line seems to break for an instant. There is a uniform on the ground, and the focus is suddenly there, everyone is staring at the man down, man down, and the crowd wheels around him. In his helmet he laughs. Man down.\n\t\n\t\t*\n\t\n\t\tThe fat man is still there. He stands against the wall, and Hawthorn sees only his shape – a bulge of cold grey with a whiter band around his middle, like something ready for the oven. Hawthorn is having his cock sucked by a skull with a buzz cut on top of hard shoulders, and he is trying not to come. Another man is investigating his arse. He laughs out loud. The sucking man mistakes this for a signal, and moves his head back and uses his hand instead, which Hawthorn taps with his own, and everything winds down. Taking a break, he says, smiling, and is not sure whether he has said it out loud or not. He goes towards the showers.\n\t\n\t\tThey have their orders. In his earpiece he hears the calm voice. They stand, they stay, they move, they wheel, they retreat. Someone is playing them like snooker. Moving them around like an arm. He waits for a bottle to hit him. None do. They fall short. They hit others. He stands there, in a trained stance, braced.\n\n\n\tWant to read it?

But one must try, right? How about this, borrowed from Granta Books, who published it in the UK:\n\n\t\n\t\tHawthorn and Child are mid-ranking detectives tasked with finding significance in the scattered facts. They appear and disappear in the fragments of this book along with a ghost car, a crime boss, a pick-pocket, a dead racing driver and a pack of wolves. The mysteries are everywhere, but the biggest of all is our mysterious compulsion to solve them. In Hawthorn & Child, the only certainty is that we’ve all misunderstood everything.\n\n\n\t*   *   *\n\n\tIn case you missed our recent newsletter (sign up on our homepage beneath where it says CONNECT), Ridgway will be making two appearance in New York. First, during the Brooklyn Book Festival (where we’ll have copies of the book at our table, #77) on Sunday, September 22, he’ll be read and discuss his work as part of a panel called \"Noir-ish,\" along with  Adam Mansbach and Nelly Reifler, taking place outside on the North Stage at 4pm. And on the evening (publication day!) of Monday, September 23, he’ll be at McNally Jackson Books in SoHo for a reading, discussion, and signing at 7pm.\n\n\t *   *   *\n\n\tFinally we get to the point of this post: sharing a short excerpt. Just the first few paragraphs, but hopefully enough to whet your appetite. By the way, I read this book about a year ago and completely failed to notice the bewildering chapter title here at the very beginning of the book: 1934. There’s no mention of the number or year anywhere else. \n\n\t\n\t\tHe dreamed he was sleeping, and Child was driving. Driving but not moving. He was sleeping on the passenger seat and Child wrestled with the wheel, but the car was still. It was the city that was moving. It was dark. The city rushed past them like words on a screen, and he would have read them but they went too fast. He was filled with sorrow. It trickled through him and filled his eyes. He wept and he didn’t know why, and he was embarrassed by it but he could not stop. He cried so much that his face disappeared. He dreamed that the siren was on, and it was so loud that it woke him.\n\t\n\t\tHe awoke. Child was driving. The city was still and they rushed through it. That was the difference. A finger across a page, taking corners not turning them, hopping little hills, drawing zigzag ciphers on the wide, empty intersections.\n\t\n\t\tHis shoulder was pressed into the door and pulled away from it and he touched his seat belt. He had an erection. He wiped at his eyes. Child was smiling at the road. He wouldn’t drive like this at any other time of the day. He wouldn’t be able to.\n \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Three Guys One Book on ‘Morphine’\n  \n  \n    ‘Hawthorn & Child’: A Longer Excerpt \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

The subject? The history of English Literature. That alone should be enough to intrigue you, but it’s also worth noting a few details. For starters, Borges was already blind when he gave the twenty-five lectures, and so everything he said, including all of the passages he quotes, was done from memory. Second, the lectures only exist in written form because a few students made audio recordings, which they then used to make the transcriptions, which were then shared with students who weren’t in the class. (The audio files, unfortunately, are lost to the ether of history; the studentes re-used the tapes in different classes.) The students were unbelievably faithful in their transcriptions, including every word he said. At one point, while reciting a poem by William Blake, he makes a mistake and starts over, and all of this is recorded for the reader’s benefit. The result is simply charming. \n\n\tThe New York Review of Books blog has an excerpt, a portion of Borges’s lecture on Boswell and Johnson and the creation of Boswell’s famous biography. Have a look.\n\n\tAnd while we’re discussing Borges the lecturer, courtesy of Open Culture are audio recordings of Borges’ Norton lectures, delivered at Harvard University in 1697-8. They, too, are remarkable. Enjoy.\n\n\tIf you’re looking for an early review, Canada’s Globe & Mail has you covered, courtesy of Michael Hingston.  \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Publisher’s Weekly on Professor Borges\n  \n  \n    Full Stop on ‘Astragal’ \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

The investigation into Neruda’s death is part of a much larger one into hundreds of human rights atrocities carried out by Pinochet and his followers over the years.\n\n\tIt’s a sad and infuriating story, for a lot of reasons, and it’s been weighing on my mind since I read it a few days ago. So to change my mood, and to remind people why Pablo Neruda was so revered (astonishing fact: after delivering his Nobel acceptance speech in Stockholm, he returned to Santiago and read before a crowd of 70,000 people!), I looked back through our archives of New Directions Readers, the annuals that James Laughlin published for many years alongside the books. Neruda appears in New Directions 8, and though are too many to reproduce here, I did scan a few, along with the cover and flap copy, to present them as they were published, rather than re-typing anything.

Scott Fitzgerald’s magnum opus  in 1945.\n\n\tFrom what I understand, Scribner’s had let the book lapse out-of-print, allowing New Directions to lease the rights. James Laughlin—a longtime Fitzgerald fan (before it was hip to be one)—acquired The Great Gatsby for its New Classics series—the jacket art (above) was designed by Alvin Lustig. The book went through only one printing before Scribner’s terminated the leasing contract for a more lucrative deal with Armed Services Editions. Today, an ND edition of The Great Gatsby goes for a few hundred dollars—a current ebay auction has a copy up for grabs starting at $548.00. \n\n\tFor a much more affordable way to own the ND Gatsby, it will be included in our forthcoming collection of Alvin Lustig postards—50 of his best ND designs in a box. \n\n\t\n\t  \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Vila-Matas Interview in BOMB\n  \n  \n    Roberto Bolaño in The New Yorker \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Irregular summer laggard. The long-term corticosteroid song less clearly articulated.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBronchodilators increase the bird-flow.

It’s an odd book, to say the least, and memorable for its pithy \"advice\" as much as for its patent brilliance. \n\n\tI also remember, however, reading Charles Baudelaire’s Paris Spleen not long after. And seeing as today marks the 192nd anniversary of Baudelaire’s birth, and despite the unbelievably nice weather in New York and the subsequent pleasant mood it tends to inspire in everyone, I thought I’d share one of my favorites from the collection, \"The Motley Fool and Venus.\" I believe we discussed it in class that day in relation to Auden’s poem \"Musée des Beaux Arts,\" which itself discusses Pieter Bruegel’s painting The Fall of Icarus.\n\n\t\n\n\tAnyway, onto the poem:\n\n\t\tVenus and the Motley Fool\n\t\tWhat a wonderful day! The vast park lies swooning under the sun’s burning eye, like youth under Love’s dominion.\n\t\tNot a sound gives voice to the universal ecstacy of things; even the waters seem to be asleep. Quite unlike human holidays, this is an orgy of silence.\n\t\tIt is as though an ever more luminous light kept making each object glitter with an ever more dazzling splendor; as though the frenzied flowers were trying to rival the azure of the sky by the intensity of their colors, as though the heat, making the perfumes visible, were drawing them up to the sun like smoke.\n\t\tYet, in the midst of all this universal joy I caught sight of a grief-stricken soul.\n\t\tAt the feet of a colossal Venus, all of a heap against the pedestal, one of those so-called fools, those voluntary buffoons who, with cap and bells tricked out in a ridiculous and gaudy costume, are called upon to make kings laugh when they are beset by Boredom or Remorse, raises his tear-filled eyes toward the immortal Goddess.\n\t\tAnd his eyes say: “I am the least and the loneliest of men, deprived of love and friendship, wherein I am inferior even to the lowest animals. Yet I, too, am made to understand and to feel immortal Beauty! Ah! Goddess! take pity on my fever and my pain!”\n\t\tBut the implacable Goddess with her marble eyes continues to gaze into the distance, at I know not what.\n \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Happy Poetry Month: Susan Howe’s ‘Sorting Facts, or 19 Ways of Looking at Marker’\n  \n  \n    Happy Poetry Month: ‘Two American Scenes’, by Lydia Davis & Eliot Weinberger \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

S. Pritchett once wrote. But Lorca’s book reaches beyond New York — “this maddening, boisterous Babel”—into the depths of the psyche, in a search for wholeness and redemption.\n\t\tIn 1936, the poet left the manuscript of Poet in New York on the desk of his Madrid publisher with a note saying he would be “back tomorrow,” probably to discuss final details. He never returned. Weeks later, at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he was brutally murdered by fascist elements in Granada, his body thrown into an unmarked mass grave. The book was published posthumously in 1940, but the manuscript mysteriously disappeared, lost to scholars for decades. The Fundación Federico García Lorca in Madrid and The New York Public Library exhibit it now for the first time, together with drawings, photographs, letters, and mementos — traces of a Poet in New York . . . and of New York in a poet.\n\n\n\tOver on the \"Lorca in NY\" website, you’ll find a program providing details on over twenty events, such as:\n\n\t• A \"musical, theatrical, spoken word celebration and interpretation of Lorca’s writings and favorite Flamenco, Sevillana and Tango songs performed by some of American’s leading spoken word artists\" at the Bowery Poetry Club on April 7.\n\n\t• A tribute concert by Patti Smith and friends at the Bowery Ballroom on June 5.\n\n\t• A Lorca walking tour in the Columbia University area, also on June 5.  \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Dunya Mikhail on NPR’s “Morning Edition”\n  \n  \n    Happy Poetry Month: Susan Howe’s ‘Sorting Facts, or 19 Ways of Looking at Marker’ \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Several prints of his iconic designs decorate our office walls, and lately we’ve been rejacketing backlist titles with their original Lustig covers.\n\n\tIn May you’ll be able to buy reprints of fifty of his designs for New Directions in postcard form. If you can bear to part with them — you might just want to plaster your wall with them — you can go ahead and throw away your existing stationary and instead use Lustig covers for all of your written correspondence.\n\n\tAs I was looking through the covers that we chose for the boxed set of fifty, I couldn’t help but fixate on the way he treated each author’s name. These are, after all, like any book, meant to convey a certain amount of information about the written words contained within the covers, so in addition to be aesthetically pleasing, they had to be thematically appropriate, and considering the experimental nature of many of the authors and books, it wasn’t always easy to nail the design. But he did. Over and over again. \n\n\tAnyway, back to the names. Because of my fixation, I decided to make this:\n\n\t\n\n\tI love the variety in how he styled Tennessee Williams’s name, or William Carlos Williams’s. Lorca written in sand is just amazing. But my favorite is Nathanael West’s name on two different stage-set building facades, from the cover of The Day of the Locust:\n\n\t\n\n\tHave a favorite Lustig design? Let us know over on twitter. \n\n\tOh, and I ended up making bookmarks out of the design above. So if you’re a bookseller and want a stack for your store, let me know: publicity@ndbooks.com. \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Anne Carson Reads “Nox”\n  \n  \n    The Seagull School of Publishing \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

First, the beautiful new (old) cover. Second, pieces written by Queneau that, for whatever reason, were left out of the original edition but have now been translated (by Chris Clarke) and added at the end. And third, homage pieces written by some contemporary writers, all of them proven stylists in their own right. A lot of these new exercises, by Queneau and his progeny, have been excerpted, and links are below. Translator Chris Clarke has also been discussing Queneau with OuLiPo member Daniel Levin Becker (author of Many Subtle Channels) here on our website. Of course there are already some reviews and appreciations of the book, too, and we’ll update this post as more arise.\n\n\tThere’s also an event in the works.

So, for everyone who has asked, yes, we will be publishing Irish author Keith Ridgway’s Hawthorn & Child, which was published by Granta books back in July of 2012.\n\n\tWe first heard about the book back in April and immediately got our hands on the Granta edition. Within a week, half of the New Directions staff had read the mesmerizing book, and all of us were cooing over it in the hallways. A couple of weeks after that we got the rights and were thoroughly pleased about it. This is absolutely a New Directions book, and we think those of you who’ve fallen in love with Javier Marías or Roberto Bolaño or László Krasznahorkai as much as we did will agree. Wholeheartedly.\n\n\tGranta’s description of the book:\n\n\t\tHawthorn and Child are mid-ranking detectives tasked with finding significance in the scattered facts. They appear and disappear in the fragments of this book along with a ghost car, a crime boss, a pick-pocket, a dead racing driver, and a pack of wolves. The mysteries are everywhere, but the biggest of all is our mysterious compulsion to solve them. In Hawthorn & Child, the only certainty is that we’ve all misunderstood everything.\n\n\n\tIntrigued yet? This novel is incredibly evocative and provocative, and the path Ridgway leads you along is endlessly captivating. Each successive chapter manages to both add to the panoramic view of the detectives’ world and, at the same time, complicate the scene, creating a pleasantly claustrophobic sense of pervasive mystery. It is — in short — addictive reading. And we can’t wait to put copies in American readers’ hands.\n\n\tStill not convinced? Killian Fox, writing for The Observer (of London) had this to say:\n\n\t\tThe real subject of the novel, perhaps, is how mysterious we are to one another and how lives are damaged, sometimes irreparably, by the gaps of comprehension. Ridgway, a Dublin author who lived in north London for more than a decade, writes these interlocking stories with the keen sense of place and lucid, pared-down prose of a good crime novel, which makes the more outlandish deviations from the genre even more arresting.\n\t\tThe most persistent mystery, in a book filled with unlikely tales, has to do with the reliability of the narrative itself. Is the novel a collective fantasy, a series of elaborate delusions? Is it all an extension of Hawthorn’s dream in the opening pages?

They are always insightful, but beyond that, as usual the traditional “invisibility” of the translator prevents us from knowing all that much about her. Or did. Because in a move that I find both fascinating and (hopefully) indicative of shifting academic currents, Wright’s papers have been gathered at the Lilly Library of Indiana University in Bloomington for archive and study. I’m really excited that someone has recognized the importance of her work, and hope it will spur others to take on similar projects in the future. I’m hoping to get out and have a look it sometime soon.  So, hats off to the Literary Translation Workshop of the IU Institute for Advanced Study for the great, innovative  translation archive they are building there.\n\n\tDLB: To your point, Michael, there are five women in the group, all of them living (though Michèle Métail and Michelle Grangaud aren’t active these days), which leaves them in the minority but, considering the total number of active members, not a statistically crushing one.\n\n\tThis seems like the place for a qualified plug of The End of Oulipo?, a new book with an awful title by Scott Esposito and Lauren Elkin. The second half of the book is billed as a feminist critique of the Oulipo, which it’s not—at best it’s a feminist critique of some of Hervé Le Tellier’s books, and arguably of Hervé himself—but it points toward a worthwhile dialogue about demographics, which I neglect entirely in Many Subtle Channels. Yes, I suppose it is a shame there aren’t more women in the Oulipo, and for all I know Barbara Wright would have been a great addition, but I don’t know that it’s any more a shame than the fact that there aren’t more foreigners, or more bisexuals, or more vegetarians, etc. The platonic ideal of the Oulipo probably includes all manner of people from all walks and styles of life (\"probably\" because that statement has not been approved by the Oulipian synod), but as it is we make do under the constraints we’re given, you know?\n\n\tAnyway, can’t wait to see that Dalkey book.\n\n\tCC:  I’m really excited about the Dalkey book too.  Pre-order on the way.\n\n\tReturning to your previous question, the other reason I’m drawn to Queneau, and similarly to Perec, is slightly different. Before I started looking into them in depth, I spent a time being quite interested in the Nouveau Roman, particularly Robbe-Grillet, Michel Butor and later Jean Cayrol. While I still greatly admire these authors and am still working through their (and their contemporaries’) works, to me the difference is this (and it might come across as simplistic or even a bit ignorant): While formal experimentation in Robbe-Grillet, in something like La Jalousie, is fascinating to study, Queneau and Perec manage to please both sides of my brain—their playful, mathematical, metalinguistic games and formal experimentation please my left brain, and at the same time, many of their texts also happen to be fun, entertaining, well-crafted novels, which appeals to the right brain (I understand the right/left brain theory may have been refuted, but hopefully the analogy still works). It’s just such a pleasure to get your language puzzle fix and decipher a formal structure and its effects at the same time that you are reading a delightful novel full of style, imagination, and humor. The best of both worlds.\n\n\tDLB: In anticipation of your next question, then, where have you gotten the same fix outside of the Oulipo? After typing that question I now suspect I’m mostly asking about what kind of books you read as a kid that might have delivered it—because it seems like there’s actually quite a lot of attention to that sort of balance in some children’s or young-adult literature (in particular Choose Your Own Adventure novels; The Westing Game comes to mind too, etc.).\n\t\n\tCC: The same fix as Oulipo, but elsewhere? Hmm. Well, it will preface my follow-up question to your last answers…. But I think for the most part it was from outside of the medium. Film, music. I mean, there are writers who have led my mind in similar directions. Cortazar, agreed. bpNichol and Steve McCaffery. Christian Bök. Bits of Robert Desnos. Sometimes Borges. But all in different ways—I think the main similarity is that metalinguistic impulse, that strong awareness of what they are doing and how they go about it. Which, now that I think of it, has to me been historically tied to poetry much more than to other forms. (I had some Choose Your Own Adventure books when I was a kid—the idea always seemed better than the execution—to me, they were too limited, there always seemed to be an obvious option that wasn’t available as a choice…  There’s an idea for a new model—a Choose Your Own Adventure in digital format where you can provide your own options and consequences, and they go into the pool for other readers, along with whatever they have added… (copyright CC, DLB & MB, hah.)\n\n\tMB: There’s a Choose Your Own Adventure iPhone app called U-Ventures started by the guy who created the original series. Maybe we could pitch it to him.\n\n\tDLB: That sounds like the worst kind of Silicon Valley venture capital firm.\n\n\tCC: A couple of other things that I’m interested in asking about. First, now that you have become familiar with the work of all the members currently involved, where do you see the future of Oulipo? Status Quo? Changes? Will a new Queneau or Perec rise up from the group and achieve that same sort of international success?\n\n\tDLB: At this point, it actually seems to me likely that the group itself will approach fame (if, you know, asymptotically) while it’ll get somewhat harder for its individual members to cultivate or maintain totally independent kinds of notoriety. That’s presupposing that the notoriety of the Oulipo as a cultural thing will continue to steadily increase, thanks in part to the tireless efforts of dudes like us, gradually raising the threshold where it shifts from the sort of thing where you’re relevant because you’re an Oulipian to the sort of thing where, as with Queneau and Calvino in the way you describe above, the Oulipo is relevant/worth exploring because you’re involved.\n\n\tI was once at a party in Paris where the young Oulipian Frédéric Forte was introducing himself to some starchy poetry guy who was evidently not very interested until Fred said je suis membre de l’Oulipo, at which point the s.p.g. sprung to attention in this appallingly obsequious way. Some degree of that seems inevitable, but I’d still like to believe all of us can at least dream about a world in which Fred can, or I can, be the first point of contact with the Oulipo for some people. Fortunately, I don’t think the bar will every be prohibitively high, unless we get that Nobel prize we’ve been mostly-jestingly lusting after.\n\n\tI have completely lost track of the point.\n\n\tMB: Future of the Oulipo?\n\n\tDLB: Right! Future of the Oulipo. More interdisciplinary, including eventually making peace with the reality and occasional interestingness of computer-generated texts. \n\n\tCC: You mention the inclusion of a more varied, interdisciplinary work; that leads to my follow-up question. Although the very name of the group directly refers to literature, what about other mediums? Isn’t there a strong formal similarity between, say, Énard’s novel Zone, Koltès’ play La Nuit juste avant les forêts, and Sokurov’s Russian Ark that crosses this boundary? Could the same work in some capacity for Oulipo?\n\n\tDLB: But of course—that’s the idea behind the proliferation of the Ou-X-Pos, workshops for potential X, for which x has been everything from music and photography to gardening and typography and biblical studies. There’s a group called the OuTraPo (ouvroir de tragicomédie potentielle), which is the closest to an all-purpose theatre-Oulipo as I know of (raising the quasi-serious question, of course, as to what more you need than tragedy and comedy to constitute theatre), and an OuCiPo, for cinema. The unifying spirit of these splinter cells being what it is, they’re not always serious or productive—some of them exist in name only—and they’d be just as likely to have discussions about the formal merits/potential of the works you mention as they would be to make their own. (But then that’s what the Oulipo was like at the beginning of its trajectory too.)\n\n\tCould it work in some capacity for the Oulipo: a complex question, especially of late. My general answer would be that the existence of these other Ou-X-Pos for different or more specialized media has allowed the Oulipo to focus on literature only (and it’s not like that’s a small taxonomic umbrella) rather than dilute its focus for the sake of taking into account things like music and film and art. That said, our most recent recruit, Étienne Lécroart, is a cartoonist who was more or less cherry-picked from the OuBaPo (ouvroir de bande dessinée potentielle, or workshop for potential cartooning)—so there’s obviously some movement toward incorporating other media already. I’m all for that continuing, so long as we’re careful to avoid doing it too wantonly.\n\n\tCC: And what about outside of the group itself? In Many Subtle Channels you discuss parallels between Oulipo and writers such as Nabokov, Cortázar, and more recent formal experimenters like Énard. So, speaking more generally, how broad of a concept is this at heart? Can we consider something Oulipian in spirit (in the same but oh-so-different way that something can be Proustian or Flaubertian or, umm, DaVinci Codian…), or should/must the designation remain tied to the group itself?\n\n\tDLB: Broad! Very broad! All Ou-X-Pian everything! Of course, there’s a slippery slope whereby you want to preserve some of the term’s elasticity (which is perhaps part of why the group has been wary to control the appellation, as it were) because it wouldn’t help anyone to see “Oulipian” go the way of “Kafkaesque” or “ironic,” i.e. widely misapplied; that said, I’m a firm believer in the plasticity of “Oulipian in spirit.” I’m pretty sure I’ve described Cloud Atlas that way within the last month. If you were to claim that, like, The Hunger Games was also Oulipian in spirit, the burden would be on you to prove why—but I think there are very few Oulipians who wouldn’t be psyched if you did. (We actually have a section on the agenda of our monthly meetings devoted to that exact purpose: it’s called “erudition,” and it’s basically solely for things we’ve discovered that are Oulipian in spirit without being affiliated in any way with any of us.)\n\n\tMB: Actually, mentioning bpNichol and Christian Bök bring one question to mind: How have Oulipians utilized technology for their writing experiments? bpNichol had a great “computer poems” program that showed concrete-like poetry run through what looks like a first-gen Macintosh; Christian Bök has been trying, somewhat unsuccessfully, to write a poem that can be encoded into a bug’s genes.\n\n\tDLB: This is a really good question that’s come up a lot before, and it’s hard to answer: the answer is that the Oulipians have thus far been pretty uninterested in using technology for writing experiments. There was a sister group called the ALAMO (workshop for math- and computer-assisted literature) that was most active in the mid-80s and involved some Oulipians, chiefly Paul Braffort and Jacques Roubaud, but it’s always been a parallel course of inquiry, and the fruits of its labors have had very little place in oulipian work to date. The way I generally account for this is to say that the people who are running the Oulipo these days are still from a generation where technological assistance is more an interesting bauble than an everyday reality. They’re not luddites by any stretch of the imagination—Braffort knows exponentially more about computers than I do, and he’s in his eighties—but they don’t seem that curious either.\n\n\tOf course, it’s possible that in a couple of decades, when the majority of Oulipians are people who’ve grown up with word processors and T9 and autocorrect and the like, that’ll change, but then again maybe not—because there is still something fundamentally humanistic about what the Oulipo exists for, and I don’t think anyone has really figured out how to reconcile technology and humanism on that level yet. (Bök and co’s \"post-human\" dabblings are deeply awesome, but they’re not the same thing at all.) Part of me wants to say that a writing workshop where you don’t count syllables on your fingers or use Scrabble tiles to make anagrams just isn’t oulipian. I know I may eat those words in a few years, but for what it’s worth I think that’s part of the prevailing attitude toward technology within the group right now.\n\n\tMB: I guess that counts out the possibility of an Oulipo app.\n\n\tDLB: Yeah, but ever since Flickr/Tumblr/Grindr started omitting E’s we’ve basically just been sitting back and letting the royalties roll in. \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Anne Carson vs. George Saunders\n  \n  \n    The New Inquiry digs into Exercises In Style \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

I’m not really the one to ask that—most everything I know about the exercises comes from the appendices of the Pléiade Oeuvres complètes, which is a wonderful collection, as well as from a few critical works that I looked through when I was writing on the substitutions in the Wright translation. You could likely answer that more accurately than me (or one of Queneau’s many biographers). I have read that Queneau was obsessed with mathematics ever since Odile (1937).  But my impression is that Exercises in Style fits in right around the point where his thoughts were turning towards the particular blend of ideas that led to his association with his soon to be Oulipian colleagues. His collection of essays, Bâtons, chiffres et lettres (1950), points this way as well, and he had already joined the Société Mathématique de France in 1948. Queneau does give me the sense (both with things he said and simply contextually) that later on, when he wrote the new preface (unused) and added, removed, and re-titled a variety of the exercises (work decided on during the early ’60s, but not executed until the 1973 edition), that Queneau was really tweaking what had for him become the bedrock Oulipo text (at least in spirit), so as to make it match up a little better with his vision of where this was all taking him. Again, not archival research here, just my impressions.\n\n\tDLB: No no, I asked because I had no idea, but what you hypothesize makes total sense. My intellect-innermost is sending me some sort of signal flare about connecting what happened between Exercices de style and Cent mille milliards de poèmes roughly a decade later: namely the process whereby Queneau shifted the responsibility of creating multiple texts out of the same nucleus from himself to the reader, to the stirrings that moved him to co-found the Oulipo. But my morning brain is refusing to make anything coherent out of it.\n\n\tCC: Okay, here’s something I’ve always wanted to ask an Oulipian. If I were to tell you I was translating a piece of your writing that involved a particular constraint, my question (depending of course on the particular piece) would be, would you tell me that I should be more concerned about translating the finished piece of writing, or about reproducing the constraint used in creating the piece? For an easy example, a “faithful” literary translation of a lipogram with no “e” that attempted to stay close to the text would almost certainly contain “e\"’s.\n\n\tDLB: [Trying to ignore the well-of-course-this-changes-everything implications of it being my writing,] I’d say it’s absolutely more important to reproduce the constraint or procedure than to reproduce the meaning. That is assuming, of course, that the constraint was instrumental in engendering the text, which almost has to be the case for the text to be like, good (in this admittedly peculiar entre-nous kind of way). If you were to translate La disparition for the story alone, you’d have a novel that’s not ultimately all that good; if you were to translate it without using the most common letter in the target language, you might not succeed in making the narrative/details “faithful” enough for it to be considered the same work, but I’d argue you’d have come much closer to preserving what’s essential about the book. (Fun aside: I recently translated Perec’s dream journal, which contains a few references to La disparition, and had an almost visceral aversion to the idea of rendering it in English as A Void, just because to me those are such manifestly different books. (The publisher has probably overridden my call on that; only time will tell.)) Anyway, an unofficial thought-test tells me this holds true for most constraint-based (or shall we say structure-forward) works that come to mind—imagine translating Abish’s Alphabetical Africa for content alone. Pointless! The pointlessness of the exercise would be rivaled only by the creepy colonialist overtones that rose to the surface.\n\n\tMB: Hey now, we publish Alphabetical Africa...\n\n\tDLB: Stanley Chapman’s translation of Cent mille milliards de poèmes is another good example. Anyway, Chris, does this square with your instincts/experience as a translator? Can you think of any notable counter-examples?\n\n\tCC: I agree, I think that’s the way it has to be looked at. It’s certainly a good point as far as demonstrating how variable approaches to translation have to be, the process really has to be reconsidered with each new context. Some of Queneau can (and has) been translated in a very “faithful,” meticulous fashion—at least compared to more constraint-based Oulipo works—that remains very close to the original like, say, Wright’s The Flight of Icarus (although I’m in no way saying these are “easier” translations, just different). Similarly, some of the exercises are pretty straight ahead, if stylistically playful. But yeah, it seems to me that the more the text leans into the metalinguistic, the more the translation has to lean towards re-creation, or rewriting, or adaptation, or however you would rather refer to it. Translating Perec’s W, or the Memory of Childhood, or An Attempt at Exhausting a Place in Paris (recently done by Marc Lowenthal: it reads best if you go and sit in the same spots) is one thing, but quite a different process than that involved if one were to try to translate Jeux intéressants or Alphabets. The same holds true, to a certain extent, within the exercises themselves. Again, see Barbara Wright’s substitutions—how do you translate into English the way it sounds to a Frenchman when an Italian speaks French? Well, you don’t. Not really. Along these lines, the way I approached “Science Fiction” or “Fear” was quite different than the process involved in translating “Oil” or “Lipogram.”\n\n\tAs for as counter-examples, I can’t think of any off the top of my head, but I suppose it’s possible that it doesn’t always work this way. There’s a challenge for you—make me a piece of bilingual Oulipian writing in which, added to whatever constraints you have chosen, you have the additional constraint to use words that have cognates similar enough in both French and English, which can be translated (substituted) without any loss other than those slight differences in nuance that you will naturally find between cognates that have grown apart over time….  At least that way, there would be no question over whose words they were :)\n\n\tDLB: I hope to be man enough to answer that challenge one of these days! In the meantime, I can only point you to some past examples of Oulipian play with words (from the corpus assembled by Harry Mathews many years ago) that are orthographically identical in English and French but purposely not cognate. (There’s also a corpus of words in “deunglitsch,” or English + German, though I don’t know much about it.) The best examples that come to mind are Ian Monk’s “seize jars pour four,” which is preceded by a vignette (in French) about four drunkards with an appetite for roast goose, and the immortal “Jean put dire comment on tape.”\n\n\tCC: I’ve got a couple more general questions about Oulipo. First, while several Oulipians, in particular Queneau, Perec, and Calvino, are read in English, both in North America and abroad, it seems to me that the larger part of the group’s members are little known outside of France. We do see the odd publication in translation of Roubaud and Bénabou, but these names and other less known members aren’t afforded nearly the same prestige here in “our” literature. Do you think this is related to the difficulty in translating the work in question? Or is it a question of taste? Is there a fundamental difference between the English reader and the French that leads to these differing levels of interest?\n\n\tDLB: Translation difficulty is potentially a factor, but I actually think that in most of the most relevant cases it’s a pretty minor hurdle. Bénabou and Roubaud and in particular Jacques Jouet—who has an enormous and estimable bibliography in French, of which only a handful of short novels (which don’t really do his oeuvre justice) have been translated—are all what I would call little known in the U.S., but it’s not because their prose presents any great challenges on the technical level. I would even venture that the challenge of translating an über-constrained Perec or an architecturally complex Calvino or Queneau presents a greater draw for the translator (if not necessarily for a publisher).\n\n\tTo me, the duller but truer reason that Bénabou and Jouet (Roubaud’s sort of a gray area) are accorded less prestige here is that an affiliation with the Oulipo doesn’t have the same cachet it does in France. This is a taste thing for sure, and a difference in the way we treat groups/-isms of historical cultural import (like, we venerate the Beats, but how many people do you see reading Diane di Prima on the subway?), and surely a question of various other fundamental differences that I get queasy about when asked to comment on. I will say, though, that the point you raise—the fact that getting Americans to read Jouet or Bénabou necessarily requires translation—makes me a little more hesitant to declare it a crying shame that the Oulipo doesn’t have the same cachet as it does in France. I know I’m putting the cart before the horse in economic terms, but there are some definite advantages, for Bénabou and Jouet et al., to not being pigeonholed in the way that Perec is. So we might have an easier time reading Bénabou as, like, the overly erudite lovechild of Thomas Bernhard and Nicholson Baker than we would fitting him into some idea of what the Oulipo is all about and the particular kind of challenge associated with reading it/him, etc.\n\n\tMB: I’d read Bénabou if the blurb “The overly erudite love child of Thomas Bernhard and Nicholson Baker” were slapped on the cover…\n\n\tCC: Sounds like you’ve got your next NDP project all figured out.\n\n\tDLB: I’m wandering into unrelated territory, though, so it seems worth putting the question back to you: what’s your own experience with the lesser-known members of the Oulipo? And what (besides what you’ve already said) drew you to be interested in Queneau and his ilk in the first place?\n\n\tCC: My experience with the other members? Hmm. Admittedly not as in-depth as I would like it to be. My introduction to Oulipo came in a way that I think might actually be fairly common among anglophone readers: I discovered Queneau, then I discovered Calvino. Quite separately, with no knowledge of any affiliation. Queneau: Exercises in Style, Zazie in the Metro, then The Flight of Icarus, Witch Grass, etc. Some in English, some in French, eventually both. Calvino: If On a Winter’s Night a Traveler, then Invisible Cities, and then I just devoured him. When the great used bookstore I worked in at the time got in a copy of Oulipo Laboratory, a collection of translations published by Serpent’s Tail in the mid-90s, I saw their names together on the front cover and an eyebrow went up. What? Two of my current favorite writers were in a literary group together with other writers, mostly French, who are just as creative and unusual as they are? Done. Eventually I got to know Perec, and Mathews (whose books you can actually find in North America). Then Roubaud and Bénabou.\n\n\tDLB: I imagine my learning process would have been similar had I not just, like, gone full throttle ahead and tried to absorb everything all at once.\n\n\tCC: Nerd confession: Another Oulipian, Bernard Cerquiglini, I know primarily through his wonderful short grammar episodes on TV5, Merci professeur!, in which he explains many language and grammar problems and curiosities I was having trouble with or interested in as a student, including many I had never even thought of. I have read work by many of the other Oulipians, but either through the Anthologie de l’Oulipo published by Gallimard…\n\n\tDLB: Some of which perhaps I even transcribed! (Have I already mentioned that this task, easily the most glamorous of my official duties as an Oulipian slave, included selecting (and then typing, evidently) those exercises from Queneau’s ninety-nine that were suitably Oulipian to be included in the anthology?) P.S. Merci professeur! is amazing.\n\n\tCC: ...or later through some used copies of the Bibliothèque oulipienne volumes now published by Le Castor Astral.\n\n\tAs for Queneau in particular, well, Exercises would come up in my studies now and again—besides being a fun and interesting read, it’s a very useful text for illustrating so many points about style, grammar, verb tense use, etc. Later, I noticed some of the various editions of his works in translation through New Directions—all translated by Barbara Wright. I couldn’t even tell you which one I read first, but I read most of them first in translation before I went back and read them in the original. One thing that I can admit is that I found Barbara Wright to be just as fascinating as I did Queneau. Her introductions to the Queneau translations, her casual but precise reminiscences and theory-for-the-layman approach really caught my attention. I know now, years later, that she was instrumental in getting me interested in, and then obsessed with, literary translation.\n\n\tDLB: I wish I knew more about her. Where would you recommend getting acquainted with her, besides through her translations?\n\n\tMB: Queneau once proclaimed that Wright had translated the untranslatable in translating Exercises in Style. It’s a shame she was never inducted into Oulipo—there aren’t very many women in the group, unfortunately. As for where I would recommend getting acquainted with Wright, Dalkey Archive is putting out a critical study of her in August called Barbara Wright: Translation as Art. I don’t have this fact memorized, I just have the Dalkey catalog handy, but it could be a good place to read more about her and her work.\n\n\t(Part 3 is here) \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     The Believer discusses Exercises In Style with excerpts\n  \n  \n    Three Percent gets excited about Exercises In Style \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Daniel is an editor at the Believer and a member of OuLiPo, one of only two Americans to be admitted (the other being Harry Mathews). He is the author of a book on OuLiPo, Many Subtle Channels, as well the translator for Georges Perec’s La Boutique Obscure, forthcoming this spring from Melville House. Chris Clarke’s translations of exercises written by Queneau that were either not included or removed from the French Exercices de style make their English debut in our new edition. The two corresponded by email back in November with ND editor Michael Barron chriping in on occasion. The first part of that conversation follows below.\n\n\t++++++\n\n\tDaniel Levin Becker: Maybe we should start with the book a little bit, if only to make it topical, and then go more general from there? For the sake of doing what I just suggested, here’s a question: what do you think is the particular relevance of Exercises in Style today?\n\n\tChris Clarke: I don’t know if I can speak so much to a “particular” relevance, it might be more appropriate in my mind to speak of a “continued” relevance. For me, Exercises in Style is the great reminder that there is no such thing as ideology-free writing. Even the simplest text, the most banal or inconsequential piece of writing, carries marks of style that affect the reader in one way or another. I don’t know if it’s fair to say that this is more important to understand now than it was in 1947, but it seems that way sometimes. Could just be a bias of time and place. But that was always the way Exercises affected me, by making me conscious of all the different ways it could affect me, and by reminding me that in its case, like in most, the whole process is intentional. Beyond that, well, I can’t not mention it, the other continued relevance of Exercises to me is simply that it’s a window into how much fun language can be, even when used to describe something as banal as a story of bus rides and button-shifting. Even the dullest crosstown trip on the S-bus can be utterly and infinitely fascinating.\n\n\tDLB: I like your point about ideology. I guess what I had in the back of my mind when I asked that was something about the fragmentation of writing these days, literary or otherwise, such that fluency (so to speak) in a number of registers maybe counts a little more than it used to, because you don’t want to tweet in the same voice as you write an essay, a blog post, an email, etc. In any case, I don’t (maybe Tao Lin does). It feels a little overserious to claim that there’s all that much of a difference between an email and a blog post, but then maybe that’s where the ideology part of it comes in.\n\n\tAlso, your comment that “the whole process is intentional” brings to mind what I’ve always thought of as one of Queneau’s most cryptic pearls of wisdom: that there is no literature but voluntary literature. I think that applies to reading too, especially in the case of reading texts that weren’t written with any literary intent as a kind of writerly exercise (there’s a much more thorough and cogent explanation of my feelings on this in Many Subtle Channels, so permit me to just let that hang there), but considering it in the context of these exercises is a wonderful way of illustrating that, no matter how simple or boring or utilitarian the idea you’re trying to express is, you make a whole set of stylistic and functional decisions the moment you put it into writing. Which, to wrap things up tidily for this email, is very probably where the whole idea that constraint is inherent in all language activity comes from.\n\n\tNext question: is it possible that language is more fun when used to describe something banal?\n\n\tCC: I don’t know if it’s necessarily more fun because it is used to describe something banal, but I think the banality of that something allows the fun to show through. It highlights its playfulness, or at least it weakens or eliminates those other attributes of a text that could captivate us. Perhaps more than the banality, at least in the case of Exercises in Style, it’s about repetition. I don’t think the banality of our jostling bus ride would have been enough to make this playfulness apparent to the extent that it is here—it’s also greatly exaggerated and contrasted because of the repetition. This seems to have been clear to Queneau as well, as even from the beginning there was an attempt to work by accumulation. The first batch, begun in May of 1942 (according to his 1963 Preface), consisted of twelve exercises, and apparently was to have the name Dodécaèdre, the French word for dodecahedron. These didn’t end up being published at that time, but when he took the project up again the following year, the initial publication included fifteen exercises, and so on from there, always in groups. The effects of repetition on humor have been written about plenty, but I don’t know that his point could have been made on banality alone.\n\n\tDLB: Excellent point about the repetition. I guess banality alone is only rarely effective as a creative conduit, and more often there’s something in the surrounding rhythm of it that makes it work. (I’m thinking of the record review chapters in American Psycho, which for some reason I’ve been re-reading/referring to often in the last couple of months; they’re hilarious because they’re so numb and deadpan, but they wouldn’t be if they weren’t sandwiched between awful grotesqueries.)\n\n\tMichael Barron: Chris, you say that there is no such thing as ideology-free writing, that everything has a semblance of style. I am curious to know how a style in the French, say “Promotional,” actually changes when rendered in English. I am also curious to know from both of you which exercises from the contributions by contemporary writers struck you as the most true to Queneau’s vision? And from there, I am wondering if you think that Queneau had a certain umbrella style that pervades all of his exercises?\n\n\tCC: I thought the new contributions were a lot of fun. To me, closest to Queneau’s method might be Frederic Tuten’s “Beat.\"  I thought Shane Jones’ “Assistance” added a neat bit of insight into the narrator, in the same way that Queneau’s “There were oodles…” does. As far as style crossing over from language to language…well, it’s one of the goals of the translator to find the closest equivalent (s)he can. Of course, no two languages operate the same way, so it’s perhaps never a perfect transaction, but it’s something translators are very conscious of. Something like “Promotional” and its French counterpart “Publicitaire” are always going to have some little differences to them, some of them because of differences in the language and the way style works in those given languages, some because of cultural differences. In this case, a radio ad is going to have a different ring to it in a North American (or British) context than it would in a French context, just as much as it will be read differently now compared to how it would have come across 65 years ago. Also, in this case, the very last line in the French text is a riff on the slogan of a French battery called Wonder, which was so popular that it spawned a variety of parodies, including the slogan of a newspaper. The English reader isn’t going to see that in the English text, as the reference is no longer physically there, and even if it were, he likely wouldn’t react the same way because he doesn’t necessarily have the same cultural references at his disposal. In cases like this, the intertextuality can’t quite be the same.\n\n\tDLB: This is much easier to answer given your comments on repetition, in that what’s feeling particularly germane and “true” to Queneau’s umbrella style isn’t any particular literary quality or sense of development, but a relatively transparent, almost self-effacing relation to the anecdote—enough preservation of the banality that the given “style” comes into some relief, but not too much. Harry Mathews’s gallicization plays it close in that way; Frederic Tuten’s “Beat” strays a little further out, but it also feels pretty faithful to the baseline repetition. Maybe Marcus’s “Nothing” and Lethem’s “Cyberpunk” come in a bit behind. The others are so stylized (a funny word to use in this context) that they don’t really accomplish the same thing. Which is not a condemnation, of course, since following Queneau’s lead is pretty limited in terms of what it’s possible to do with this text.\n\t\n\tWhich, if any, of Queneau’s own styles do you suspect may not belong (per my criteria above or per your own)?\n\n\tCC: That’s a difficult question. The easy answer is sort of cheating: “Permutations by Groups of 2, 3, 4 and 5 Letters,” “Permutations by Groups of 9, 10, 11 and 12 Letters,” “Reactionary,” “Haiku,” “Feminine,” and “Mathematical.” These are the exercises that Queneau removed from the French edition in 1973. He suggested that these expunged exercises were “out of date or poorly rendered” and he decided to replace these “overly elementary” pages with “exercises of a more elaborate rhetoric,” and “more technical.” Of course, keep in mind that this is nearly 30 years later, so his tastes have changed, but it’s also a chance for Queneau to go back and retroactively tweak Exercises a little to let it closer match the Oulipo ideals, which had been formed halfway between the year the book was originally published and the year he updated it. (The exercises he replaced them with are grouped together in the new translations: “Set Theory,” “Definitional,” “Tanka,” “Lescurian Trans-lation,” “Lipogram,” and “Geometrical.”)\n\n\tBeyond that, it’s hard to say. A few of the substitutions that Barbara Wright made in the first translation stick out to me, just because of their nature, but that’s another question. One reason that so many of them feel so linked stylistically, in spite of their forced differences, is that many of them started out as more or less the same text—a number of the more mathematically constrained exercises found later in the collection (like the various “Permutations,” as well as “Prosthesis,” “Epenthesis,” “Paragoge,” and “Metathesis,” etc.) are based on a version very similar to “Narrative,” which some have described as the most neutral and regular in appearance.\n\n\tQueneau did a remarkably self-restrained job of sticking with the same wording unless the constraint or style of the given exercise forced him to change something, and in turn Barbara Wright was consistent in her own word choices to maintain this symmetry. As I had no intention of touching any of Barbara Wright’s translations when I undertook the further exercises, I tried my best to maintain her word choices within my own translations in those places where Queneau’s words in the further exercises matched the original 99. Hopefully this “umbrella style” remains consistent from the earlier to the later exercises.\n\n\tDLB: Gangnam style + Hurricane Sandy = Umbrella style. I’ll get my crack team of meme-mongers on the case.\n\n\tCC: I’ve got a question that is a bit of a change in direction, but I was wondering, did the Oulipians document any sort of a chronology? Did they keep track of who came up with which constraint, and who did what first?\n\n\tDLB: The shortest answer to your question about a chronology of who came up with what in the Oulipo is: no.\n\n\tThe second shortest answer is that pretty much every time someone proposes to do something new and cool, his or her excitement is punctured by the refrain Georges y avait pensé, meaning that Perec had totally thought of it already. (Jacques Jouet, who became an Oulipian in 1983, the year after Perec’s death, has a funny little memoir about how quickly this became maddening.)\n\n\tA well-meaning, but ultimately unhelpful, answer is that there’s a mock periodic table (the table queneleieff, which is viewable in the 1981 anthology Atlas de Littérature Potentielle and maaaybe in the Oulipo Compendium?) that lists the forms and constraints the Oulipo had used thus far by scope, i.e. phoneme-based, letter-based, word-based, etc. I’m pretty sure, however, that there’s no chronology associated with it.\n\n\tCorollary to the first and shortest answer is that I think a chronology like the one you describe is understood as the work of scholars studying the Oulipo, not by the Oulipo itself (and I count myself in both camps). Not that the group shirks the responsibility to do so—despite the Georges y avait pensé thing above, most Oulipians are thoroughly versed in the pedigree of Oulipian techniques. And let’s not forget that the Oulipo has been archiving its paper trail for over 40 years, even though like, only six people in the world have ever seen those archives. In theory someone could trace, in an annoyingly inefficient way, the lineage of something like the sardinosaure—but that this seems to be the sort of thing scholars build careers on arguing and confabulating about, whereas for the group it’s potentially more of a pit of theoretical quicksand that might prevent actually getting anything new done. This is complete speculation by this point, by the way.\n\n\tCC: I can see what you’re saying about the chronology—it has to be about potential literature, not past literature, right? To take the question a little further, though, was there a competitive spirit to the group? In Bâtons, Chiffres et lettres, Queneau explains a bit of his “degree of difficulty” system for the lipogram—how frequent the use of a particular withheld letter is found in the language, multiplied by the number of different letters withheld from the text, multiplied by the length of the text, or something along those lines. Did this sort of quantification lead to one-upmanship?\n\n\tDLB: Really good question. There must have been some sense of competition in the era we’re talking about, but it’s all pretty much off the page. It has to be intuited from remarks like Jouet’s about his every new idea being always-alreadied by a dead guy, or Jacques Roubaud feeling the sting when, in reading Queneau’s journals, he discovered an entry that referred to one of his texts as a Christmas story even though the text in question had nothing at all to do with Christmas. This is almost too literary of an answer, but I feel like to some extent the prevailing sense of competition was with oneself. I’m thinking in particular of Perec writing a novel without the letter “e,” then deciding that that wasn’t arduous enough and writing a novel without a, i, o, u, or y.\n\n\tIn the present day I’m tempted to say it’s a similar situation, but that’s also likely because I’m rarely in Paris, so I miss out on the day-to-day rumblings that lead to multiple people working at the same form or constraint. But then part of the sustainability of the group is that everyone’s interests are a little out of sync, just enough so that most of the time the interest in replicating someone else’s exploit isn’t to do it better, but to do it differently. In fact, the place I’d call most competitive is the Liste Oulipo, where a dozen or so people are all working at any given moment on the same “source text” and tweaking it in different ways—there it’s much more common, from what I’ve seen, for member two to seize on an idea member one has just posted and be like, “Yeah, good idea, I thought I’d try it out with the same constraint and ALSO make it a palindrome.” With, you know, varying degrees of tactfulness.\n\n\t**Parts 2 & 3 are now available. \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Lustig Names\n  \n  \n    László Krasznahorkai on Anxiety in The New York Times \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

For a bit of context, Bobby Van’s Steakhouse, now a corporate chain with several locations, was once a Bridgehampton favorite of the ’70s literary scenesters who summered out in the Hamptons, with many of the era’s heavy hitters counted among the regulars, as you can see below.\n\n\t\n\n\tThe note reads:\n\n\t\tJim Jones, Truman Capote, Willie Morris, John Knowles. I was Bobby’s BOOKIE for a year.\n\n\n\tA couple of questions arise. First, who took the photograph? Was it James Laughlin? If not, why would we have it in our possession? And secondly, who wrote the note? I personally have a hard time believing the JL was anyone’s bookie, ever, but I suppose you never know. And if not JL, who was Bobby’s bookie (and why only for a year)?  \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     City Lights Bookstore celebrates László Krasznahorkai’s Satantango\n  \n  \n    New Kamau Brathwaite Poem: “Human Nature” \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

The production quality, to be frank, is rather poor, but it’s still a joy to look at pictures of Borges getting in a hot air balloon in California, sitting in front of gigantic statues in Geneva (where he’s buried), staring up at a minaret in Istanbul, or sitting on a bench in the Labyrinth in Crete.\n\n\tBut for my money the best picture is Borges with a tiger, at an unidentified zoo:\n\n\t\n\n\tThe text accompanying this image begins:\n\n\t\tThere have always been tigers in my life. Reading has been so interwoven with all the other habits of my days that I really don’t know if my first tiger was the one in a book engraving, or that other one, long dead, whose stubborn coming and going around the cage I watched in fascination from the opposite side of the iron bars. My father was fond of encyclopedias; I judged them, I’m sure, according to their pictures of tigers.\n\n\n\t*   *   *\n\n\tThis image immediately made me think of this cover for a University of Texas edition of Borges’s el Hacedor, published in English as Dreamtigers, using the title of one of the short book’s prose pieces. The cover is a woodcut by Uruguayan artist Antonio Frasconi, and he perfectly captures Borges’s closing lines:\n\n\t\tOh, incompetence! Never can my dreams engender the wild beast I long for. The tiger indeed appears, but stuffed or flimsy, or with impure variations of shape, or of an implausible size, or all too fleeting, or with a touch of the dog or the bird.\n\n\n\t\n\n\t*   *   *\n\n\tAnd just for fun, a picture of Borges with a cat. \n\n\t \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     The Telegraph Calls Satantango One of the Best of the Year\n  \n  \n    “Lipstick Traces”: Bookforum on Clarice Lispector \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Their panel discussion on the process of translating the famed Chilean writer’s work was exceptionally interesting. \n\n\tThe evening began with Andrews reading a paper on key elements of Bolaño’s \"fiction-making system.\" \"What is this system?\" Andrews said: \"How does it work? Bolaño’s fiction invites us to read it genetically, looking for traces of method in the finished work,\" Andrews said. \"[There are] three procedures that can be discerned by genetic reading: expansion, meta-representation, and the circulation of characters.\" These methods are not new literary devices, but are utilized brilliantly by Bolaño. For example, Andrews compared Bolaño reccuring characters to a technique used by Balzac and even James Fenimore Cooper. Regarding Bolano’s use of story expansion, Andrews noted that \"Bolaño himself explains in a preface to Distant Star that he blew up the final chapter of Nazi Literature in the Americas because he ’would have preferred a longer story that, rather than mirroring or exploding others, was, in itself, a mirror and an explosion.’\" Andrews concluded his portion of the evening by talking about Bolano’s naturalness, or his \"impression of ease\" (a phrase he borrows from Nora Catelli). \"Bolaño seemed to have been a compulsive storyteller,\" said Andrews, \"and where other Spanish writers seem to struggle with placing a philosphy or idea within plot, Bolaño was able to do this without much seeming effort.\"\n\n\tThe discussion was then handed to Wimmer, who gave a fascinating talk about her translation process. She begins, she says, with a literal translation and then works from that to obtain a true translation. She brought up many conundrums a translator faces, such as the struggle to give lift to even the most banal sentences; when to break run-on sentences; how to find voices within Bolaño’s work; and how to translate slang. \"Spanish,\" Wimmer said, \"maintains steady rhythm in its syntax, whereas English comes off as free-jazz.\" She mentioned that the most difficult part of 2666 to translate was in \"The Part about Fate,\" Seaman’s long, folksy monologue about the Black Panthers and cookbook recipes. \n\n\tThe discussion was followed by a Q&A in which an audience of MFA students asked the two esteemed translators about translating Spanish into different kinds of English (American vs. British, for example); the number of drafts a translator goes through in making a manuscript; the editing process for translations; and how the two translators view each other’s work. For an interesting comparison of their work, we recommend reading the slightly different versions of \"Jim,\" a story that was published in Andrews’s translation  in The Insufferable Gaucho, and as an essay in Wimmer’s translation in Between Parentheses. \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Interview with a Bookseller: Hans Weyandt\n  \n  \n    Bookslut on Xi Chuan’s Notes on the Mosquito \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

While visiting a friend in the Twin Cities a few years back, I made it a point to visit the store (and the Ashbery Bridge, which is very cool… the big cherry not so much) and loved it from the moment I stepped inside. Micawber’s is, to mind at least, the quintessential independent bookstore: the tables are stocked with personally chosen titles; the staff recommendations are made with great care and attention; and the owners are there, right behind the counter, as much as they can be. Hans also recently edited (and wrote the introduction to) Read This! Handpicked Favorites from America’s Indie Bookstores, published by Coffee House Press in September. Since he clearly now has oodles of spare time, I sent him some questions about bookselling and books and the book business. So without further ado…\n\n\tTom: First, before we get into some nitty gritty bookselling topics, introduce your store to everyone, and give us a sense of the literary community in the Twin Cities, which, I’m afraid, many people are unfamiliar with.\n\n\tHans: Micawber’s Books has been in the same location in St. Paul, Minnesota since 1972 and I bought it with Tom Bielenberg in 2003. We both had worked, previously, at Hungry Mind. Despite our old-fashioned tendencies we can be found online, with a blog, on tumblr, and on Facebook.\n\n\tAll of the midwest is often referred to as fly-over country and I’m not going to attempt to convince people otherwise. I’m comfortable with the fact that a lot of people don’t know where Minnesota is. I’m happy to say that we have a glut (in a good way) of book and literary happenings here. Coffee House, Graywolf, and Milkweed all have offices within a few miles of one another. We have Consortium and Bookmobile and an emerging literary journal world with Thirty Two and Paper Darts and Revolver (and Rain Taxi still doing their thing).\n\n\tT: When I was in your store during a visit there, I was struck by how very hands-on you are, even by independent bookstore standards. Would you describe yourself that way? And what do you think that brings to the store?\n\n\tH: Well, there are only five people who work at the store, and that includes myself and the other owner Tom Bielenberg, so it’s one of those situations where I don’t even really know if the answer is due to personality or sheer necessity. Probably both. There are times where I’ve ordered a book from the catalog, done the data entry, unpacked it from the box, and shelved it. I want our store to be constantly changing. I want our front tables and displays to be different every single time a customer comes in. For one it shows that we’re always getting new stock. It keeps us on our toes and makes customers look around a little more.\n\n\tT: The last time I saw you — in New Orleans for ABA’s Winter Institute — the topic of co-op came up, and you told me that you simply don’t do it. Can you explain the practice as you experience it, and explain your decision?\n\n\tH: Simon & Schuster gives co-op for author events and many other orders of quantity. So we take what any publisher automatically gives. But we’ve never reported, or asked for, co-op. I don’t want to be self-righteous about it. The simple fact is that I want to be able to say that every book we display or talk about on the blog is there because we want it to be, and not because someone is paying us for the space. I don’t want us ordering or displaying books like detergent on the end-cap at a grocery store. I should also note that the world of co-op is such shell game. I hear publishers complain that stores will submit claims for ridiculously small numbers and I hear stores whining that they aren’t getting what they should be getting.\n\n\tT: From your perspective, what do you make of the current situation in the publishing industry?\n\n\tH: It’s probably not much of a reach to say that its a mess. Are Random House and Penguin joining? [postscript: They have!] I think there is some opportunity for smaller presses to really focus on what they do well and have lists that aren’t too big, all of it smartly done. There is some power in the fact that an entire list is cared about and gets some attention. The reality is that a lot of books don’t sell well because they weren’t marketed or given attention.\n\n\tT: You recently edited a book that collects recommendations from booksellers across the country, so I have to ask, how do you approach recommending books when a customer asks for one?\n\n\tH: The fun and the difficulty is that it’s different every single time. It’s personal. You can always get a recent book the person liked or an author or even genre and go from there. You have to be willing to get turned down a lot. It’s like speed-dating, I suppose. Thick skin is required. I think a lot of booksellers would agree that one of the best feelings is when someone comes in says, \"That book you recommended last time was perfect.\"\n\n\tT: Also regarding Read This!, am I to understand that the boxes to the left of the titles are for readers to check off the titles they’ve read already? Are you basically challenging them?\n\n\t\n\n\tH: Yeah, that’s what the boxes are for. You’re trying to stir up trouble, Mr. Roberge. The boxes were actually someone at Coffee House’s idea — one of the ways to make the book an interactive object. There are certainly a lot of lists in there where I wouldn’t be able to check off many boxes. It’s going to take some time but I am in the process of reading one book from each list.\n\n\tT: This past summer — in June I think it was — I got an excited phone call from you about a rather successful recommendation to a book club leader. Can you tell the story again?\n\n\tH: I can’t remember the exact details but the basic idea was that a guy is part of a large alumni group (500 or so people) that reads one ’under-the-radar’ or ’obscure’ title every year. He had heard that I read a lot of fiction and wondered if I could offer a suggestion. I went with Satantango by Krasznahorkai. The idea that so many people are discovering the joys of that book is pretty cool.\n\n\tT: Lastly, what one book to you think you’ve hand-sold more than any other? Or is there a book you’ve tried to hand-sell a lot, but that never seems to appeal to anyone?\n\n\tH: We’ve sold a lot of Joseph Mitchell’s Up in the Old Hotel. I just checked and we’ve sold 170 copies of Robert Clark’s Mr. White’s Confession. That book has a little noir to it and great scenes of St. Paul circa 1940. That’s not the most of any book I’ve sold but it’s a pretty good number. A Book of Reasons by John Vernon is something I try to sell a lot and it rarely works. The book is about the author getting to know his reclusive brother by going through his home and personal items after his death. It’s not an easy book to describe in one sentence and people often say, \"Hmm, that seems a little dark,\" or it’s pretty clear that is what they’re thinking. I feel bad because it is a lovely book. You gotta keep getting back on the horse and trying, right?\n\n\t*   *  *\n\n\tTo which I’d say, \"Yes, again and again.\"\n\n\tOddly, that sounds a lot like The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, a book I happen to love and which I recommended to a friend many years ago. Several years later, early one morning (or perhaps late at night for him) he sent me a very long email saying he’d finally read it on my advice, and loved it, and explained why. Point being, one day it works, and it’s that much more rewarding in the end. Thanks again to Hans for taking the time to answer my questions, and for his overall commitment to books. \n\n\tYou can read our first bookseller interview, with Dustin Kurtz (formerly) at McNally Jackson Books here.  \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Muriel Spark Nominated for The Best of the Best Prize of the James Black Tait Prize\n  \n  \n    Out and About: A Panel Discussion with Bolaño Translators Chris Andrews and Natasha Wimmer \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

To read through (the long, amazing list of) reviews and interviews with DeWitt, visit the book’s page — but not before you read the short excerpt below, a glimpse of DeWitt’s subtle mastery of the language of salesmanship as she skewers American ideals and sexual mores. \n\n\t*   *   *\n\n\t\tOnce he had a foot in the door he explained, “It’s not for me to make moral judgments. I’m a businessman. I deal with people as they are, not as they ought to be.”\n\t\t“Speaking as a businessman,” he went on, “I know that it is often the most valuable individuals in a company who present the greatest vulnerability to sexual harassment related issues. We know that a high level of testosterone is inseparable from the drive that produces results. Speaking of people as they are rather than as they should be I know that a high-testosterone-level individual has a high likelihood of being sexually aggressive; if the individual is working twenty-hour days as a driven results-orientated individual often does, that sexual aggression will find an outlet in the office.”\n\t\t“Well.”\n\t\t“You invest in training. A man is bringing in $100 million of business. You leave him open to the danger of momentarily forgetting himself with a little $25,000-a-year secretary?”\n\t\t“Well . . .”\n\t\t“A properly run organization protects its employees.”\n\t\t“Sure, but . . .”\n\t\t“I have strong views on sexual harassment. I believe that those in a place of work who do not welcome sexual advances should not be subjected to them. I also believe that a man who is producing results in today’s competitive market place has a right to be protected from potential undesirable side effects of the physical constitution which enables him to make a valued contribution to the company.”\n\t\tAt this stage he might be asked, “Are you suggesting we hire prostitutes?!” Or “Surely you are not suggesting…!”\n\t\t“Certainly not,” he would protest, “prostitution is degrading to all concerned, an atmosphere of mutual respect is indispensable in the modern office.”\n\t\t“I don’t understand,” he would be told.\n\t\tThe concept was so revolutionary at the time that prostitution was the only thing people could think of. That was how original he was. He had to explain the whole thing from the word Go. He would explain the concept of the lightning rod in the face of skepticism.\n\t\tHe would explain the importance of confidentiality.\n\t\tHe would say: “The last thing we want to do is ghettoize a certain class of women. What we are doing is introducing highly qualified professionals to the workplace.

The book begins with his first published poem at age seventeen and ends with his last, long poem, “Response and Reconciliation.” Perhaps uniquely among the 20th century masters, his last poem was one of his best. \n\t\tI’ve taken this opportunity to fill in gaps among the previously untranslated, to present the poems of his last years (which have never been in English in book form), and to revise my old translations, some of which go back forty years. For the notes, rather than the usual factual identifications, I have taken Paz’s comments on his own poems from interviews and personal conversations, so it becomes a kind of “Paz on Paz” running commentary.\n\t\tMuch larger than a Selected Poems, but smaller than a Collected Poems (which would run to a few thousand pages), this is an overview of an extraordinary life in poetry, almost seventy years of recurrent themes and continual stylistic innovation, a poetry about nearly everything, a “tree within” with roots in pre-Columbian Mexico and branches that spread out across the world.\n\n\n\t*   *   *\n\n\tThe two poems below, both written towards the end of his life, help fill in that gap. \n\n\t\tBreathing\n\t\tStill bodiless:\n\t\tdisheveled spring.\n\t\tInvisible yet tangible,\n\t\tit leaps around the corner,\n\t\thurries by, vanishes,\n\t\ttouches my forehead: no one there.\n\t\tSpring air.\n\t\tNobody knows\n\t\thow it appears and disappears.\n\t\tThe sun opens its eyes:\n\t\tthe world\n\t\thas just turned twenty.\n\t\tLight beats behind the blinds.\n\t\tSprouts shoot in my thoughts.\n\t\tAir more than leaves,\n\t\ta flutter barely green,\n\t\tthey turn for a moment and scatter.\n\t\tTime weighs a little less.\n\t\t                                            I breathe.\n\n\n\t•   •   •\n\n\t\tThe Same\n\t\tAs morning begins\n\t\tin a deep-rooted world,\n\t\tevery thing is the same.\n\t\tThe quiet flare\n\t\tof the rose that opens\n\t\tin the arms of air.\n\t\tAnd the quiet of the dove\n\t\tcome from who knows where,\n\t\twith white feathers and darting eyes.\n\t\tFace to face, far and near,\n\t\tthe disheveled rose,\n\t\tthe polished dove.\n\t\tThe bodiless wind\n\t\truns through the branches:\n\t\teverything changes, nothing remains.\n\t\tThe rose has two wings\n\t\tand nests in a cornice,\n\t\tsettling in the vertigo.\n\t\tPerfection unleaving,\n\t\trevived by its scent.\n\t\tthe dove is flower and flame,\n\t\tThe different is now the same.\n\n\n\t*   *   *\n\n\tYou can read an early review here.  \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     César Aira Speaks with Interview Magazine Germany\n  \n  \n    Melville House Discusses Why Lawrence Ferlinghetti has Turned Down the Janus Pannonius Prize \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Established this year, the prize carries a 50,000 Euro financial award.\n\n\tAfter doing some research on the Pannonius Prize, Ferlinghetti discovered that a sizeable portion of the prize money had been provided by the Hungarian government, which has been widely accused of officially and unofficially stifling free speech. In light of this news, Ferlinghetti decided to decline the award, and sent this message to the President of the Hungarian PEN Club:\n\n\t\tDear Geza Szocs,\n\t\tAfter careful research into the Pannonius Prize and its sponsors, including the present Hungarian government, I have come to the following conclusions: Since the Prize is partially funded by the present Hungarian government, and since the policies of this right-wing regime tend toward authoritarian rule and the consequent curtailing of freedom of expression and civil liberties, I find it impossible for me to accept the Prize in the United States. Thus I must refuse the Prize in its present terms.\n\t\tHowever, assuming the total devotion of the Hungarian PEN Club and yourself to freedom of speech and social justice, I propose that the Prize money be used to set up a fund to be administered by the Hungarian PEN Club, said fund to be devoted solely to the publication of Hungarian authors whose writings support total freedom of speech, civil rights, and social justice. These are the only terms under which I can accept the Pannonius Prize.\n\t\tIn defense of individual freedom and democratic institutions, I am faithfully yours,\n\t\tLawrence Ferlinghetti\n\n\n\tAt that point Mr. Szocs offered to exclude the Hungarian government’s contribution to the prize money and to begin negotiations surrounding the proposed fund, but Ferlinghetti is steadfast in his views, saying:\n\n\t\tI hereby refuse the Prize in all its forms.

Since he’s largely unknown in the English-speaking/reading world, we thought we’d offer an informal introduction. \n\n\tTo begin with, however, we should offer the caveat that there really isn’t a great deal to be offered simply because, as translator Katherine Silver points out in her preface to the book, \"biographical information is sparse and anecdotal.\" She goes on to say:\n\n\t\n\t\tRafael de la Fuente was born in Lima in 1908. By the time he was a young adult, he had lost every member of his immediate family: his younger brother died who when they were children, his father, his mother, and finally the aunt and uncle under whose care he had been placed. He attended the German High School, where many of his classmates and teachers were or would become leading figures in Peru’s artistic and intellectual life of the twentieth century.\n\t\t\n\t\tWhen \"The Cardboard House\" appeared in 1928, it was received with high critical acclaim, published within the warm embrace of a prologue by Luis Alberto Sánchez and an afterword by José Carlos Maríategui. Adán was hailed as a great innovator of Peruvian literature and the most promising young writer of his generation. For several years he moved in Lima’s literary circles and marginally participated in the political and cultural debates that raged at that time. \n\t\tSoon thereafter, the traces of his life fade into an alcoholic haze. There are anecdotes about the coffee houses he visited, the odd scrapes of napkins on which he wrote his poems, his increasing isolation, and the long periods of internment in hospitals and clinics of various kinds. He died in 1985, his final years spent shunning all public attention and only allowing visits from his editor.\n\t\t\"The Cardboard House\" is the only prose text Martin Adán ever completed. Some six or seven volumes of poetry were published during his lifetime and this due largely to the painstaking and devoted labor of Mejía Baca, who collected the bits and pieces of paper Adán left strewn along his path. He is now considered to be one of the greatest Latin American poets of all time. \n\n\n\t*   *   *\n\n\tAllen Ginsberg visited Lima in the ’60s, and met with Adán in a hotel lobby, where they spent a long night talking about — what else — poetry. Ginsberg’s poem \"To an Old Poet in Peru\" was written shortly after, and is, though he doesn’t name Adán, about him. (You can listen to Ginsberg reading it here.)\n\n\t\t\"To an Old Poet in Peru\"\n\t\tBecause we met at dusk\n\t\tUnder the shadow of the railroad station\n\t\t                                     clock\n\t\tWhile my shade was visiting Lima\n\t\tAnd your ghost was dying in Lima\n\t\t            old face needing a shave\n\t\tAnd my young beard sprouted\n\t\t            magnificent as the dead hair\n\t\t                         in the sands of Chancay\n\t\tBecause I mistakenly thought you were\n\t\t                                melancholy\n\t\tSaluting your 60 year old feet\n\t\t            which smell of the death\n\t\t                        of spiders on the pavement\n\t\tAnd you saluted my eyes\n\t\t                 with your anisetto voice\n\t\tMistakenly thinking I was genial\n\t\t                                    for a youth\n\t\t(my rock and roll is the motion of an\n\t\t                        angel flying in a modern city)\n\t\t(your obscure shuffle is the motion\n\t\t                          of a seraphim that has lost\n\t\t                                 its wings)\n\t\tI kiss you on your fat cheek (once more tomorrow\n\t\tUnder the stupendous Desamparados clock)\n\t\tBefore I go to my death in an airplane crash\n\t\t                        in North America (long ago)\n\t\tAnd you go to your heart-attack on an indifferent\n\t\t                        street in South America\n\t\t(Both surrounded by screaming\n\t\t            communists with flowers\n\t\t                        in their ass)\n\t\t—you much sooner than I—\n\t\t            or on a long night alone in a room\n\t\t            in the old hotel of the world\n\t\t                        watching a black door\n\t\t            . . . surrounded by scraps of paper\n\n\n\t*   *   *\n\n\tWhat we do have, however, is The Cardboard House, which Silver suggests is the notebook that houses his life’s words. Of the book, a series of fragmented scenes composed as the narrator travels around Barranco, a a seaside town on the outskirts of Lima, she says:\n\n\t\tEach fragment, and even each image within each fragment, is a world unto itself, vibrating through Adán’s power of evocation. Most critics have given up looking for any thematic or narrative development, and only the narrator and Ramón — his friend, alter ego, and rival — could possibly qualify as characters Adán borrows — from Proust, from Joyce, from Góngora — but he laughs at himself for doing so, as he laughs at his nation for that native and premature desire that Europe will make of us men. He makes no bones about who he is: a provincial boy in a semicolonial world who experiences the modern world as it is exported to him.\n\n\n\tAs mentioned above, this is a new edition. Graywolf published Silvers’s original translation in 1990, and for this edition she has gone back to make \"significant though not extensive changes.\" Of this re-reading and re-translating, she says:\n\n\t\tComing back to this text twenty years later, I find this small, unique gem from the seacoast of the south shimmering even more brightly, but I now perceive more fully the swirls of darkness that would so overwhelm the poet’s life.\n\n\n\tThe praise may seem a bit biased coming from the translator, but Publishers Weekly, who reviewed the book back in 1990, said that if you are willing to accept the fragmented style, you \"will probably enjoy the richness of Adan’s imagery and the musicality of his language.\"\n\n\t  \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     César Aira Interviewed at Ox and Pigeon\n  \n  \n    The Los Angeles Times on Lawrence Ferlinghetti’s Refusal of the Janus Pannonius Prize for Poetry \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Queneau took a simple plot — a moment of confusion on a bus — and retold it in ninety-nine different ways, each version a stylistic wonder, from \"Sonnets\" to \"Onomatopoeia\" and \"Animism.\" The result is a masterpiece of experimental fiction, which was then gorgeously translated by Barbara Wright. For Exercises in Style’s 65th anniversary, we wanted to somehow honor it with more than the usual thoroughfare of a new cover and introduction. So here’s what we’ve included:\n\n\t• Previously unpublished exercises: Translator Christopher Gordon Clarke offers twenty-five previously unpublished exercises by Queneau, including “Science Fiction,\" ”Promotional,” and “Oil.”\n\n\t• Tribute exercises: Some of our favorite contemporary authors writing their own exercises.\n\t“Instructions” — Jesse Ball\n\t“Doppelgangers\" — Blake Butler\n\t“Viscera” — Amelia Gray\n\t“Assistance” — Shane Jones\n\t“Cyberpunk” — Jonathan Lethem\n\t“Nothing” — Ben Marcus\n\t“For Zeu Frentch” — Harry Mathews\n\t“Contingencies” — Lynne Tillman\n\t“Beat” — Frederic Tuten\n\t“Metaliterario” — Enrique Vila-Matas, translated by Anne McLean\n\n\t• The restored classic cover: Below is our slightly modified version of the 1958 edition published by Gaberbachus in London. (The original New Directions edition is based on this.) Note that the handwritten type on the cover is by the same illustrator who drew the iconic, exercising people letters found within the book, Franciszka Themerson.\n\n\t\n\n\tStay tuned for more Exercises in Style-related content, including an conversation between OULIPO member and Believer editor Daniel Levin Becker and translator Christopher Gordon Clarke. \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     The Guardian on Lightning Rods\n  \n  \n    The Kenyon Review Interviews Anne Carson about “Unwriting the Books of the Dead” \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Sally Bowles is often the focal point, and it’s hard to argue with that decision, especially when she’s rendered as well as she is in the Vintage, Signet, and Penguin Modern Classics editions. The simple hardcover edition (second row, far left) is beautiful, but stark in comparison. I have an unhealthy love of pulp novels and the sleazy covers that adorned them for several decades, so my bias is perhaps predictable, but the Signet edition is the winner to me. The reading line gives it the edge: Bohemian Life in a Wicked City.\n\n\t\n\n\tNow let us cast nostalgia aside for this stunning new cover designed by Paul Sahre. The flat image here doesn’t do it justice, but the lights are actually printed with metallic inks, giving the cover a sharp glint, which seems very apt for the book. The second image below is a photo of the book as it appears on our shelves, an attempt to give you an idea of how stunning it is.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tAnd we’d be remiss if we didn’t share these images, too: first, Isherwood’s author photo, taken, I believe, in California; and then Isherwood with Auden. Isherwood was a man who knew how to hold his head just so. \n\n\t \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     The San Francisco Chronicle on the Career of Lawrence Ferlinghetti\n  \n  \n    The Guardian on Lightning Rods \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Alas, Dustin left the store in late June, moving to Melville House Books, and I know I’m not alone when I say that he will be missed. So as way of thanking him for all of the New Directions titles — especially poetry — that he recommended over the years, I thought I’d make him answer some questions about bookselling and the literary world in general. Having immediately devoted himself to Melville House the way he had previously at the bookstore, we just got around to finishing this interview earlier this week, but that doesn’t make his thoughts and opinions any less interesting. Oh, and to provide some context, I should mention that I, too, used to be a bookseller at McNally Jackson.\n\n\tTom: Before we get into serious bookselling territory, let’s gossip. Working at a store in trendy SoHo, I’m sure you’ve had your fair share of celebrity encounters. So what’s the best? I’ll always remember, for example, selling Jim Jarmusch a copy of Daniel Pinchbeck’s 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl.\n\n\tDustin: I’ve actually tried to be good about not giving away the reading peccadilloes of the celebrities that come by the store. We don’t keep customer purchase records, and I don’t publicize it when some of my favorite actors waltz through. But just between you and me and the internet, Paul Giamatti has amazing taste in literature, and Annie Clark reads some heavy, divisive nonfiction. Of course, Thurston Moore reads all the cool kid poetry, but then that guy has also taught at Black Mountain and by this point is publishing the cool kid poetry, so that’s not really news.\n\n\tT: The Golden Rule of retail, even in bookselling, is “the customer is always right.” But we both know that when it comes to facts surrounding books — titles, authors, publishers, colors of the covers, etc — that this isn’t always the case. How do you negotiate these little “misunderstandings?”\n\n\tD: The golden rule of obnoxious retail chains is \"the customer is always right.\" The real golden rule, the one decided upon by Vollmann and true even in bookstores is \"Do unto others as they would be done unto.\" Of course, much of what people would like to have done unto them is just endless affirmation of how very right they are, so that’s what you do. \"Oh, well, you had the first letter in the title right!\" \"Oh, you want non-fiction just like Water for Elephants? Let’s see if we can find you something you’d like.\" You just kind of step lightly around their idiocies, get them what they want, and then, as an aside, maybe mention something they might like that happens to be really genuinely great as well. It’s about empathy, I guess, something that doesn’t always come naturally to me toward the end of a ten hour shift. But every now and then, if you’re lucky, you meet customers you can treat like adults, customers who, going back to the Vollmann rule, would like to be given the benefit of the doubt: that they can handle a joke, or honesty. Of course we all think we could handle honesty or a joke, or to be herded towards truly great literature. And thankfully some of us — I’m not saying it’s me, I may be a terrible customer, it’s hard to tell from within the orbit of your own skull — some of us can. I suspect those people are also often just good individuals with which to surround yourself. Not easy to do.\n\n\tT: When a customer says that they’re looking for a good book, what are the various approaches you take?\n\n\tD: That’s always the catch, right? Nobody comes in looking for a solidly mediocre book. The first step with any customer is asking them what they’ve enjoyed recently. \"Good\" is an impossibly relative term. But my general tactic is, if customers are looking for one good book, give them at least three. Give them a book quite similar to what they said they enjoyed reading. Sometimes this will be something more obscure by the same author, or just something newer. Second, give them something just slightly different, but still in that general strike zone. And lastly, give them the real curveball, something that’ll whip across the plate at an angle so sharp they can’t clock it correctly. Give them something Albanian. Give them someone long dead. Give them something strange staple-bound and hard to get and perfect for them in ways you could never have known without poring over their browser history. Most people will only buy the first two (it is very hard for them to decide to put all three back). But those readers who walk out of the place with that third book, the ones whiplashed by the spin on that last strange bit of translation, are getting something special. What’s more, they feel like they’re getting something special. They feel like they’re engaged, like they’re unique, and hell, in most cases they’re right.\n\n\tT: Over your five(?) years of bookselling, what sort of trends have you noticed: from customers, from publishers, from authors themselves?\n\n\tD: It’s been six years now, I think. Jesus is that a long time. Anyhow, as for trends I think we could all name them. There has been the great progression of bookseller bugbears, one titan after another rising up to cast us into the shade. The age of Barnes & Noble was wrapping up just as I came on. The big terrifying chains were still extant, but their relentless expansion had really tapered off. So for the span of a few years the corporatization of publishers and its concomitant big payday celebrity culture was the most-talked-about bad guy. This was the time of If I Did It and other shameful ventures. Not that I have anything against shameful books. Most of my favorite books are about shame, now that I think about it. Maybe I mean that that OJ book and its ilk are just the opposite, then; shameless books. All along, though, smart booksellers knew that Amazon was the problem. Not just ebooks. As much as we are enthusiastic about the form of the book, we are still, most of us, in the business of selling the content, not just the package, and don’t hold grudges against people who like their words to be on screens, those with wood pulp allergies or whatever. It is Amazon specifically, and their winner-take-all labor as grist, debasement of the literary ethos that is and has been the problem. \n\n\tApart from the progression of bad guys I think there have been some hopeful trends. It may be observational bias, but I think the scene is awash in cool little publishers right now. The barriers to putting out a strange great book, without having to  staple it yourself and call it a zine, seem lower than they’ve ever been. And it’s not like these are books that are just not good enough to have been put out by the big six. Some of this stuff is the best thing to hit stores that year, particularly as far as poetry is concerned. I also think translations have become a bit more ubiquitous, and customers have become a bit less hesitant to read them. I think maybe we’ve finally gotten past that famous three percent number. \n\n\tIf there are trends from customers I haven’t noticed them. Everyone still wants to know where the bathroom is. Everyone is buying thrillers and heavy dour literature in the same measure. \n\n\tT: In your opinion, what do publishers do right, and what do publishers do wrong?\n\n\tD: Ah, this is a difficult one to sum up. I have a grand time sniping at publishers for, for example, safe book cover design (\"No, no, make her face blurrier goddamn it!\") or  for terrible jacket copy, but it’s hard, from a bookselling perspective, to step back and see what all publishers are doing wrong. It’s easy to say, you know, \"publish interesting books\", because I think many publishers are, they’re putting out some damned good work, more than I have time to read anyhow. If there is a lot of crap out there, too, well, that is because people want it. They’ve been trained to want it, certainly, but I’m not the one to tell someone the book they’ve specifically asked for is terrible. Good booksellers guide their customers, sure, but for some of these people looking for E.L. James or Dan Brown, that’s the only book they’ll read that year. Hell, just let them. \n\n\tPublishers get accused of being inflexible a lot, and I don’t know that that’s true either. I see some individuals out there trying some innovative stuff. What people really mean when they talk about publishers being more flexible, streamlining and coming to terms with the future, is basically a cataclysm. They want these publishers to self destruct and come out slimmer and with, frankly, less power to stand up to malign behemoths like Amazon. Flexibility is fine until you’ve broken your own back. Or at least, that’s what some people mean. Others are just spouting jargon to justify the attention they’re being given. There’s a lot of that.\n\n\tT: Can you talk a little bit about the collaborative efforts of publishers and booksellers, and how their efforts and yours coincide, even when you aren’t directly working together? I’m thinking specifically in terms of their marketing and publicity efforts.\n\n\tD: McNally Jackson isn’t as big as some of the bookstores out west, of course. Real estate limits us here in New York. And we’re not a chain with some of the buying clout of, say Indigo. But we do have an outsized voice, and it’s something we’ve worked to cultivate. What booksellers have that all publishers would like a bit of access to, I think, is the day to day contact with readers and a pretty accurate claim to something like impartiality. That is, we aren’t telling you a book is good because our livelihoods depend on selling you that particular book. If a publisher asks to use us a loudspeaker for their publicity efforts, were usually happy to help, not least if that publisher is New Directions, say. That doesn’t compromise our integrity, if that’s what you want to call it. After all, we’d be more than willing to say no if we thought a joint publicity effort wouldn’t serve our customers. Usually, however, it never even gets to that point. We’re at a place now where publishers know us and what we do enough that they won’t even bother with something that wouldn’t suit us. I think publishers are a bit afraid of inundating booksellers with noise about their books, and that’s legitimate, but I welcome it. Joint publicity and marketing works best if we know it’s coming. \n\n\tT: I know McNally Jackson currently has two employees who work part-time shifts in addition to their day jobs — in publishing. I think this is brilliant, because I often feel that publishers are a few too many steps removed from their customers. Make a case for it.\n\n\tD: Oh absolutely. We’re lucky to be able to do it, being in New York. The benefit to McNally is that these individuals are usually working full time in publishing, meaning their part time bookstore jobs are a bit of a burden. You know, then, that these people love bookstores and bookselling. Usually that’s the difference between a good clerk and a great capital-b bookseller. But yes, I think the real benefit is to these guys and their houses. I know you and some other savvy folks from publishers big and small make an effort to get into stores pretty regularly, but it’s definitely not the rule, and I’ve just never understood that. Just at the most basic level, if you don’t like books enough to be drawn to bookstores with an almost scary devotion, what business do you have making the things? And just coming into our store would help some issues we see, particularly where repetitive or even identical jacket design is concerned. But working in a bookstore, as you of course have, is even better. Publishers have all their comp title numbers and plans, but if they are not envisioning what a bookseller could say to get a book into the hands of its audience, then they are doing a disservice to book and audience both. \n\n\tT: Lastly, what one title do you think you’ve handsold more than any other. (I won’t be offended if it isn’t a New Directions book.)\n\n\tD: Ah, this is tough. I’m as prone to fleeting enthusiasms as the next guy. I’m an enormous fan of Sam Delany, and much of his work does well on its own, but I’ve worked to get people to read his amazing exploration of sex and semiotics and the master/slave dynamic in his Neveryon series. I had a lot of success introducing people to Cesar Aira with the New Directions edition of Ghosts. The spare jacket on that one helped, as well as the fact that it might still be his most accessible one to have been released in the states. Castellanos Moya’s Senselessness is a standby when I think a reader needs to be unsettled a bit.  I’ve had some luck getting people excited about the perhaps-now-moribund Ibis Editions, and Open Letter’s two books by Sergio Chejfec. I’m still working to get everyone on board with Renee Gladman, but it’ll happen. Those successes, though, can be enough to get a person through a whole week. The job has plenty of rewards, but that moment, man, that tops them. \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Electric Literature and Helen DeWitt\n  \n  \n    Bomblog Speaks with Johnny Lorenz About Traslating A Breath of Life \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Below is an excerpt that we’re posting in Marker’s memory.\n\n\t\tThe French documentary filmmaker, photographer, and traveler, Chris Marker, was a poet first. Marker’s twenty eight minute ’La Jetée’, written and photographed during the early 1960s, imagines a third world war. A man, marked by an image from his childhood, travels through some intertranslational fragmented mirror memory to the original line of fracture no translation will pacify. Many pilots, men and women, survived, though they didn’t survive, collective military service during World War II. ’La Jetée’ (1962) and ’Sans Soleil’ (1982) are haunted by indwelling flames of spirit. In the beginning of each Marker film jet planes escape the eye of the camera. One is overhead roaring murder. We see the other being concealed under the flight deck of an aircraft carrier. ’La Jetée’ is called a ciné-roman; ’Sans Soleil’ a documentary.\n \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     The Millions on Enrique Vila-Matas\n  \n  \n    Suicide Girls and Anne Carson \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

While many of these pieces are republished from our editions, there are four previously unpublished works that make their debut in Wildlife. One of these, \"What Makes a Poet a Tick?\" (written in response to the question \"What Makes a Poet Tick?\" Mr. Weinberger has graciously allowed us to reproduce here. \n\n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\"What Makes a Poet a Tick?\"\n\t\tA tick is very small, the size of a single letter in a book. Who would notice? Its survival is dependent on a chance encounter with a host brushing past the leaves or grass. It wanders a body anonymously, searching for its place, and when it settles, it maintains its obscurity by emitting an anaesthetic so its host won’t feel the impending bite. It cuts the skin with the pincers of its chelicerae and inserts the scary, serrated prong of its hypostome. From its midgut it injects a complex saliva with vasodilators to keep the veins and capillaries open, a whole family of anticoagulants to keep the blood flowing, agents to subdue threatening immune responses, and a kind of moisture-resistant glue to remain attached. It injects saliva, draws blood, injects saliva, draws blood, and grows fat, the size of a single letter in a chapter title. In its saliva are tens of thousands of bacteria; among them, the spirals of borrelia burgdoferi that induce facial paralysis, arthritis in the joints and numbness in the extremities, heartbeat irregularities leading to dizziness and fainting, perpetual sleepiness, and an inability to concentrate or to remember. When it has eaten, the tick drops off. The nourishment allows it to produce the hundreds of eggs it lays in the ground.\n \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Helen DeWitt in The Believer\n  \n  \n    The Millions on Enrique Vila-Matas \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

But it is a historic office — many great authors have walked through its halls and have stood on the balcony overlooking lower Manhattan. Many of the employees can place fond memories in just about every nook of the office (where someone’s hand was kissed by Tennessee Williams, or the unlikely location of James Laughlin’s office (not the corner office!). Over the years there has been talk of giving new breath to the home of New Directions in the form of a new paint job. But it wasn’t until this summer, after a few knockout publishing seasons, that the green light was given to allow the office the facelift it deserves. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tIt was decided to paint the offices two each per weekend. Every employeee was given a coat to choose for their space in colors ranging from \"Quiet Forest\" to \"White Raspberry.\" That was the easy part. The actual task of clearing each office to allow the painters to completely coat the walls was daunting — books had to be removed from shelves; knick-knacks from desks, and portraits & memorabilia from where they hung. All went into containers — from cardboard boxes, to U.S. Postal crates to towering stacks — placed along the ever-narrowing hallway eventually becoming so thin that employees had to contort their bodies in funny shapes to pass through. During the process we discovered many artifacts that included ash trays from when it was still permissible to smoke in the office, flyers from events that took place in the 90s, letters and postcards, and the plant that one employee claims has been alive and thriving since 1971 — perhaps the longest employed member of the ND staff!\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSo here’s to summer refreshment and thirty years and counting of publishing great literature from this office.\n\n \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Full Stop on “A Breath of Life”\n  \n  \n    The Rumpus on “The Secret of Evil” \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

The evening began with Wood giving, at length, a summary of his thoughts on Krasznahorkai’s ouevre to the audience before delving into conversation with the Hungarian writer about his work and style of writing. The event concluded with Krasznahorkai reading the section \"Irimiás Makes a Speech\" from Satantango before signing books (for over an hour!).  If you weren’t fortunate enough to attend the event, you can still watch this video clip of the great Hungarian writer reading \"Irimiás Makes a Speech.\"\n\n\tThe following day was Laszlo’s last in the big apple, so ND President and Publisher Barbara Epler took him on pilgrimages to the more far-flung attractions of the city — The Louis Armstrong Museum, the 1964 World’s Fair grounds, The New York City panorama at the Queens Museum of Art, the Lemon-Ice King of Corona, and Chinese lunch in Flushing before ending the day at the Lenox and Showman’s Lounges in Harlem.

This, of course, is nonsense. While this may be true for some people, most people’s reading habits don’t change because the weather does. If this were true, people in Florida would never read the Russian masters and Alaskans would never read anything but the Russian masters. And that simply isn’t the case.\n\n\tAs publishers of \"serious literature,\" our titles tend not to appear on these lists, so we’re going to make our own humble recommendations. Although we’ve already said that we don’t believe that everyone is making (or has already made; it’s already very, very hot in New York at the moment) that mental switch to lighter fare, we have chosen these \"summer\" reads for specific reasons, which we’ll explain as we go. \n\n\tBad Nature, or with Elvis in Mexico\n\tby Javier Marías\n\n\tDespite what we said above, we do admit that when it gets warm, certain books come to mind because of their setting. The Sheltering Sky; Under the Volcano; Blood Meridian; The Moviegoer; you get the point. And since I read this novella by the Spanish master, this one. It is, as the title suggests, set in Mexico, where Elvis and his assorted hangers-on and handlers are shooting a film. The narrator, a young Spaniard, is hired because Elvis insists on a proper Castilian accent for his Spanish lines in the movie. But being the only Spanish speaker on the crew, he ends up being dragged along when Elvis decides he wants a bit of local color. They end up in a dive bar full of tough men, and an awkward situation develops when the Mexican patrons insist that he translate everything Elvis and his men have said… including the unsavory parts.\n\n\tI’d also like to point out that this book is part of our Pearl series. It’s under 75 pages and at 4.5\" x 7\" should easily fit in a back pocket or small purse. Personally we hate carrying anything, especially in the summer, so we’re always looking for books that don’t require a sturdy tote bag (See: Marías’ Your Face Tomorrow novels). \n\n\tThe Hour of the Star \n\tby Clarice Lispector\n\n\tLook at the new cover for our new edition of Lispector’s last novel and masterpiece, translated by her biographer, Benjamin Moser. Doesn’t that just scream summer? Beneath that neon-bright sun, however, is a poor, ugly, and sickly young woman from Rio named Macabéa, who wants to be loved like Marilyn Monroe and yet never will be, but at the same time has no idea that she should be unhappy, and happily goes about drinking Coca Cola and seeing all of the new movies. Tragedy, as perhaps you’ve guessed, isn’t far off. \n\n\tBut what truly makes this book perfect for the summer is its style. Lispector is an economic writer (this one, too, is short; only 128 pages), but she makes great use of those words, providing only the most devastatingly incisive details about Macabéa’s sad life. For me this meant that I had to close the book every few pages to take stock of the world, the people around me, life in general, because Lispector is, more than anything else, a philosophical novelist, interested in the subjective nature of an individual life. So as you, too, muse on these things, you’ll have time to take a sip of that Campari and soda. \n\n\tA Coney Island of the Mind\n\tby Lawrence Ferlinghetti\n\n\t\n\n\tSummer in New York means trips to Coney Island. The Freak Show. The Cyclone. The boardwalk full of Russian and Ukrainian immigrants from neighboring Brighton Beach. It’s a wonderful holdover from another era, and many New Yorkers will be very sad when the long-circulating rumors finally come true and the aging attractions are razed in favor of Disney’s sanitized version of family fun.\n\n\tAnd in addition to inspiring songs by everyone from Les Applegate to Tom Waits, the locale inspired Ferlinghetti’s breakthrough poetry collection and serves as the backdrop for a lot of the slice-of-life scenes he so beautifully presents. Admit it, it’s been a while since you read this instead of studying for chemistry in high school. Pick it up again and let those memories of carefree summers come flooding back.   \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     BOMB Interviews Chris Andrews\n  \n  \n    Barnes & Noble Review on Clarice Lispector \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Take, for example, this post by Nicholas Mirzoeff, an NYU professor, author, and the creator of a blog where he posts daily observations about Occupy movements around the world.\n\n\tWriting about the situation in Greece back in January, he evoked Sophokles’ Antigone, along with its reinterpretations and allusions to it, most recently in Alexis: A Greek Tragedy. \n\n\t\tHow do you countervisualize when your goal is not to mow down the other side in the street but to catalyze a sense of alienation into social transformation? In ’Alexis’, a cross historical identification of the abandoned body of Alexis was made with that of Polynices, Antigone’s brother for whom she sacrifices herself. The widespread A for Anarchy in Exarchia was read as also signifying Antigone. Giorgio Agamben’s question: “what life is worth being lived?” is understood as a reading of Antigone’s refusal to submit to Creon’s law and the current questioning of ways of being.\n\t\tThe square was visualized as the interface of four projects:\n\t\t• The interface of the ancient text of ’Antigone’ with Brecht’s interpretation and the historical legacies of the theme in Greece\n\t\t• The multi-year performance of ’Antigone’ by Motus [the Italian theater group the performed ’Alexis’]\n\t\t• The already “historical” events of 2008, an event already forgotten by the media when the group began to investigate them in 2010\n\t\t• The moment of Occupy, from Tahrir to OWS and beyond\n\n\n\tSeveral months later, Mirzoeff received his own alert, this one from Amazon, letting him know that Anne Carson’s translation of Antigone, called Antigonick, had been published. He promptly read it and composed the post linked to above. Interepreting someone else’s interpretations is always a tricky endeavour, but the results are thoroughly thought provoking. To wit:\n\n\t*All information in brackets is mine, added for clarification’s sake.\n\n\t\tAlex Tsiras of Syriza said of Greece “we are going directly to hell,” meaning a living death underground. Which is what happened to Antigone. As Carson reminds us, the myth has power today because it still affects us. She uses words like ’anarchy’ where the standard translation uses “unruly.” She talks of the “state of exception.” How to measure that?\n\t\tIn the nick. In the nick of time. By Nick.\n\t\tEurydike, Creon’s wife, mother of Haimon who Antigone was to marry, has famously few lines in Sophocles. One speech, five lines.\n\t\tCarson has her speak much longer, with a riff on Virginia Woolf. Then she asks a question about Antigone [formatting has been altered; Carson hand lettered the text and it’s impossible to properly convey the aesthetic online]: \n\t\t’But how can she deny the rule to which she is an exception? is she AUOTIMMUNE? No she is not. Have you heard the expression THE NICK OF TIME? What is a nick?\n\t\tWhat indeed? The OED gives us an astonishingly long entry. It refers to a notch, a cut, a groove, whether in a machine, a tool, wood or an animal. It can refer to the vagina, as in various Jacobean dramas cited by OED. Then it is also the precise moment, later the nick of time. It is essential, what is aimed at. You can also go to the nick, a jail or prison, and be beset by Old Nick, the devil.\n\t\tAt the end of the play, Nick [a character in Carson’s translation, described as ’a mute part (always onstage, he measures things)] still on stage measuring. Measuring the collapse of autoimmunity, the collapse of debt’s capital, the capitals of debt.\n\n\n\tThat’s just a sample. To truly appreciate Mirzoeff’s insights, you’ll have to read the entire post.  \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     The Nervous Breakdown on “The Secret of Evil”\n  \n  \n    The New Inquiry on “Antigonick” \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

G. Sebald’s beloved masterpiece The Rings of Saturn. It’s impossible not to crave to see what the narrator sees on his walking tour of the Eastern English Coast, and though the curious archive of photographs offers glimpses of the scenery, fans have always wanted more. \n\n\tLo and behold, as you can see in the video below, director Grant Gee has created a wonderful ode to the novel in the form of a feature documentary entitled Patience (After Sebald). Structured around a walk in East Anglia, the film explores the relationship between literature, landscape, history, life, and loss. \n\n\tThe film made its US debut at the New York Film Festival back in September, and New York Times critic  A. O. Scott had this to say about it:\n\n\t\tGrant Gee’s “Patience (After Sebald)” is, to some degree, a survey of the work of the German writer W. G. Sebald, who spent most of his career in England and whose books, blending fiction, memoir, philosophy and travel writing, defy easy classification. The film, assembling critics and colleagues to reflect on Sebald’s 1998 book, “The Rings of Saturn,” is both an essay in interpretation and an attempt to replicate the writer’s distinctive, elusive sensibility in a visual medium. “Patience (After Sebald)” tries to be both descriptive and immersive, explaining its subject even as it reproduces aspects of his style.\n\n\n\tNeedless to say, we’re very excited about this, and are even happier that it’s opening at one of our favorite theaters in New York — Film Forum. The premiere screening on May 9 will feature Rick Moody, who will introduce the film and discuss Sebald’s work. Showtimes and tickets are available here. \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     The Coffin Factory on “The Secret of Evil”\n  \n  \n    Publishers Weekly on César Aira’s “Varamo” \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Explaining his \"Bird for the Daughters of Juarez\" (below), he writes:\n\n\t\tThe underlying thematic device, for me, seems to be the world’s rapid untethering from any idea of sanity. The murdered women part of ’2666’ is where we hear Bolaño at his most ferocious. The murder of innocents is still a thing of incomprehensible sadness; well-worthy of moral outrage even in an insane world.\n\t\tI’ve heard people describe this book as “apocolyptic” or “millennial,” whatever the fuck that means. I’m not so sure. I’m not so sure about anything with ’2666’ – even as to whether it was completed or not.  Oddly enough though, I was convinced I’d read a great book – in fact, a great few books.\n\n\n\t\n\n\tAfter looking through his blog and at many more beautiful Juarez-inspired pieces (here, here, and here, for example), I got in touch with him and offered to send him some of our Bolaño novels. When he got the package, he called to thank me and we ended up talking for an hour — about everything from Charles Bowden to boxing. Needless to say, I’m a fan.\n\n\tAnd then yesterday he posted this image:\n\n\t\n\n\tNew Directions’ kindred spirit that he seems to be, Fitzpatrick has had a long and loving relationship with the city of New Orleans, and specifically with Tennessee Williams. In the accompanying text, he writes:\n\n\t\tThe one who interests me the most in this most American of plays is Stella. Stella Kowalski knows her mentally-challenged, Pop-Tart of a sister and her brutal, sexually rapacious husband are headed toward one another like two locomotives, and it has always seemed to me that she practically curtsies to get out of the way as this happens; knowing that both will exact their temporary satisfaction, as well as their own damning punishments from this act.\n\t\tAfter Stanley rapes Blanche, he is finished as a man. Even he knows it. Blanche is taken away to an institution and grateful for “the kindness of strangers” and Williams hints that they get not only what they deserve, but perhaps, darkly, what they actually want.\n\n\n\t Well put. \n\n\t\t \n\t\t \n \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Fwriction Interviews Translator Susan Bernofsky\n  \n  \n    Guernica Interviews László Krasznahorkai \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

And since it contains first editions of Lustig-designed titles by Ezra Pound, Tennessee Williams, Nabokov, and on an on, we like to show it off to visitors. All of that handling, however, means that the books get out of alphabetical order. It’s like a bookstore in that way, I suppose (I do not miss shelving books). \n\n\tToday one of our interns, Annie, is going through the shelves and putting everything in the proper order. Not the most challenging or edifying task, but there are perks. She came across, for example, a collection of Inuit poetry — called Anerca — that one is urged to recite aloud with a drum accompaniment.\n\n\tAnd then there’s this:\n\n\t\n\n\tSee that little note that says it was originally published as The Hunt? Well, it turns out that New Directions published that book in 1952, and presumably sold the reprint rights to Berkley Books for this edition some years later. This is our edition:\n\n\t\n\n\tOur cover is absolutely not sexy, while theirs puts sex front and center.\n\n\tComparing the description copy is interesting, too. Berkley’s reads:\n\n\t\tFORCED INTIMACY\n\t\tA young and beautiful girl finds herself trapped in a lonely cabin in the Rockies with two men — her murdering fiancé and his evil brother. Now a web of terror and hatred draws these three desperate people down into an orgy of violence and death…\n\n\n\tWhile ours reads:\n\n\t\tThis powerful first novel by a new young writer of exceptional promise is bound to compel wide critical attention. It is the story of a murderer’s flight, exciting both on the level of sheer physical narrative and in its reconstruction of an involved psychological motivation. Forces he could not comprehend drove Christopher to kill; insight came only in the dreadful aftermath, when the girl who loved him too much and the brother who understood him too little attempted his rescue. \n\n\n\tThe only common thread is a tendency towards hyperbole.

Eliot Weinberger has described him as a ’polymath, equally at home discussing the latest American poetry as Shang Dynasty numismatics.’\"\n\n\tOne of the most fascinating aspects of Xi Chuan’s body of work is the very clear distinction between the poems he wrote from 1985-1987, and the poems he’s written since 1990. Klein explains:\n\n\t\tXi Chuan in his early writing reflected a belief in an international poésie pure. His poems often demonstrate the exposed structures and urban timelessness of International Style architecture, or else an abstracted landscape that is clearly China yet, at the same time, not. The landscape exists inside a poetics of mythic power.\n\t\t\n\t\tThe high-lyricism of Xi Chuan’s earliest poetry would not last. Because of the government’s suppression of the democracy and workers’ rights movement in Tiananmen Square, in which Xi Chuan participated, 1989 was a hard year for China’s young intellectuals; it was an even harder year for Xi Chuan, as on March 26, [his dear friend and fellow poet] Hai Zi committed suicide (he was twenty-five), and on May 31 their mutual friend and fellow Beijing University poet Luo Yihe died from a cerebral hemorrhage (age twenty-eight), days before PLA tanks rolled in on the demonstrators on June 4.\n\t\t\n\t\tXi Chuan barely wrote for two years. Nothing in this book is from 1989, and only one poem is from 1990. By 1991, his style was shifting: a haunting memory replaces Xi Chuan’s earlier timelessness in \"Twilight,\" pushing the modernist lyric beyond its upper limits the way \"plains push out from the edge of the city / mountains lift up at the edge of the plains\" (’Three Chapters on Dusk’), and ’Bats in the Sunset’ raises the question of whether the bat—a sign of good luck, since it is a Chinese homonym for ’fortune’ — should be defined by its Chinese associations or its Western ones, via Goya’s El sueño de la razón produce monstros. \n\t\t\n\t\tWhen Salute was published in 1992, it was evident that Xi Chuan’s poetry had undergone a radical transformation. His self-contained lyric opened into expansive prose poems that often reflexively observed their own poetic method… including their representation and construction of poetry, metaphor, and language. Rather than undercutting lyricism à la Han Dong, Xi Chuan’s prose poetry allowed him to reevaluate it and examine, rather than take for granted, the interplay between Chinese tradition and a modernity of Western origin.\n\n\n\tBelow are three poems: one from that first period, and two from the latter.\n\n\t\t\"The City I Live In\"\n\t\t\n\t\tThe city I live in is made of building blocks\n\t\twith straight streets and smooth public squares,\n\t\tand row-houses low but meticulously ordered\n\t\t\n\t\tThe city I live in has no people\n\t\twind blows through windows a frail, naïve whistle\n\t\tthe rising and setting sun compelling seasons to revolve\n\t\tthere is only dust in the city I live in\n\t\t\n\t\tIf I died, if color and light died,\n\t\tno hand would come knock down this city\n\t\tit will exist forever\n\t\tbecause in the city I live in there are no people\n\n\n\t \n\n\t\tfrom \"Beast\"\n\t\tThe beast, I see it. The beast, fur thick and stiff, teeth sharp, eyes nearly lifeless. The beast, gasping for breath, growling ill fortune, and from its feet, no sound. The beast, with no sense of humor, like a man straining to hide his poverty, like a man ruined by his mission, with no cradle to provide memories, no destination to locate yearning, not enough lies to plead for itself. It smacks a tree trunk and gathers infants; it is alive, like a cliff, and dead, like an avalanche.\n\tA crow amongst scarecrows searches for a partner.\n\t\n\tThe beast, it despises my hairstyle, despises my scent, despises my repentance and reserve. In a word, it despises that I deck out happiness in baubles and jewels. It squeezes its way into my room, orders me to stand in the corner, and with no word of explanation collapses in my chair, shatters my mirror, shreds up my curtains and all that belongs to my spiritual defense. I beseech it: “Don’t take my teacup when I’m thirsty!” Right there it digs up a spring, which I suppose must be some kind of response. \n\t\n\tOne ton of parrots, one ton of parrots’ nonsense!\n\n\n\t​​​\n\n\t\tfrom \"On My Meaningless Life\"\n\t\t88. In a crowd of people some people are not people, just as in a flock of eagles some eagles are not eagles; some eagles are forced to wander through alleyways, some people are forced to fly in the sky.\n\t\t\n\t\t89. I fall asleep as soon as it gets dark, I get up as soon as it’s light out. I always dream of a doctor with a fever and a mail carrier with a toothache, and then I meet them; so in order to meet myself I must dream of myself, but dreaming of oneself is so embarrassing.\n\t\t\n\t\t90. Once I had a dream in which a blind man asked about someone. I replied that I had heard of but didn’t know this person. When I awoke, I howled in shock: it was me that the blind man had been looking for!\n\t\t\n\t\t91. Only when a nail pierced through my hand did my hand reveal the truth; only when black smoke choked me to tears could I feel my existence. Riding sidesaddle on a white horse ten fairies tore up my heart.\n\t\t\n\t\t92. For this I have changed my name, concealed my identity, wandered lonely as a cloud, resigned myself to fate.\n \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     The Daily Beast on Bolaño\n  \n  \n    Found: One (1) Lusty Book in Our Library \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Too long. Sorry about that.\n\n\tAs you likely know, April is National Poetry Month. Not coincendtally, we just published two new collections of poetry: Xi Chuan’s Notes on the Mosquito and a collection of mostly poetry by one of our most beloved backlist authors — Kenneth Rexroth. In his introduction to In the Sierra: Mountain Writings, editor Kim Stanley Robinson says, \"Though no single book of Rexroth’s was devoted to the Sierra alone, he wrote about it often enough over the years that a book’s worth of pages accumulated. This is that book; it contains most of what Rexroth wrote about the Sierra Nevada.\"\n\n\t\n\n\tRexroth himself one said, “I have always felt I was most myself in the mountains. There I have done the bulk of what is called my creative work. At least it is in the mountains that I write most of my poetry… There whatever past emotion and experience I choose to recollect and write down, take on most depth and meaning.”\n\n\t\tClimbing Milestone Mountain, August 22, 1937\n\t\t\n\t\tFor a month now, wandering over the Sierras,\n\t\tA poem had been gathering in my mind,\n\t\tDetails of significance and rhythm,\n\t\tThe way poems do, but still lacking a focus.\n\t\tLast night I remembered the date and it all\n\t\tBegan to grow together and take on purpose.\n\t\t            We sat up late while Deneb moved over the zenith\n\t\tAnd I told Marie all about Boston, how it looked\n\t\tThat last terrible week, how hundreds stood weeping\n\t\tImpotent in the streets that last midnight.\n\t\tI told her how those hours changed the lives of thousands,\n\t\tHow America was forever a different place\n\t\tAfterwards for many.\n\t\t                                       In the morning\n\t\tWe swam in the cold transparent lake, the blue\n\t\tDamsel flies on all the reeds like millions\n\t\tOf narrow metallic flowers, and I thought\n\t\tOf you behind the grille in Dedham, Vanzetti,\n\t\tSaying, “Who would ever have thought we would make this history?”\n\t\tCrossing the brilliant mile-square meadow\n\t\tIlluminated with asters and cyclamen,\n\t\tThe pollen of the lodgepole pines drifting\n\t\tWith the shifting wind over it and the blue\n\t\tAnd sulphur butterflies drifting with the wind,\n\t\tI saw you in the sour prison light, saying,\n\t\t“Goodbye comrade.”\n\t\t                                       In the basin under the crest\n\t\tWhere the pines end and the Sierra primrose begins,\n\t\tA party of lawyers was shooting at a whiskey bottle.\n\t\tThe bottle stayed on its rock, nobody could hit it.\n\t\tLooking back over the peaks and canyons from the last lake,\n\t\tThe pattern of human beings seemed simpler\n\t\tThan the diagonals of water and stone.\n\t\tClimbing the chute, up the melting snow and broken rock,\n\t\tI remembered what you said about Sacco,\n\t\tHow it slipped your mind and you demanded it be read into the record.\n\t\tTraversing below the ragged arête,\n\t\tOne cheek pressed against the rock\n\t\tThe wind slapping the other,\n\t\tI saw you both marching in an army\n\t\tYou with the red and black flag, Sacco with the rattlesnake banner.\n\t\tI kicked steps up the last snow bank and came\n\t\tTo the indescribably blue and fragrant\n\t\tPolemonium and the dead sky and the sterile\n\t\tCrystalline granite and final monolith of the summit.\n\t\tThese are the things that will last a long time, Vanzetti,\n\t\tI am glad that once on your day I have stood among them.\n\t\tSome day mountains will be named after you and Sacco.\n\t\tThey will be here and your name with them,\n\t\t“When these days are but a dim remembering of the time\n\t\tWhen man was wolf to man.”\n\t\tI think men will be remembering you a long time\n\t\tStanding on the mountains\n\t\tMany men, a long time, comrade.\n\n\n\tThe last section of the book contains various prose — newspaper columns, sections from a WPA guide that was never published, portions of his autobiography, among other pieces — and a few letters. Below is a pair of letters between Rexroth and James Laughlin, New Directions’ founder, editor, and all-around adventurer. As Robinson says, \"The correspondence is mostly taken up with discussions of the business and politics of literature and publishing. The way Rexroth continually badgers and insults Laughlin shows that he is comfortable saying anything to his old mountain friend, and is suggestive of a rough campside humor. Laughlin is wonderfully skillful at deflecting these frequent attacks, but his later published comments about Rexroth are a little ambivalent and barbed, as if the frequent insults and his own easygoing replies had eventually taken their toll on him (see Laughlin’s Byways for an example where he is “getting even” with Rexroth). Rexroth lost many friends over the years who could not abide his temper, but possibly the mountain trips with Laughlin made them deeper friends; some of the letters in their exchange make it clear they were very close. In the end, Laughlin paid for the private nursing Rexroth needed after his last strokes.\"\n\n\t\tLaughlin to Rexroth, June 15, 1937\n\t\t\n\t\tDear Rexroth,\n\t\t\n\t\tIn spite of your last letter saying that you are going up into the Sierras before my arrival I still hope that you will break a toenail or something and will be still in San Francisco when I get there. . . .\n\t\t\n\t\tRexroth to Laughlin, October 21, 1939\n\t\t\n\t\t. . . . How far away the mountains seem. Even more so when one is in them these days. I have been doing a lot of climbing this fall — every piton I drive in is like a fond kiss at the station as\n\t\tthe troop train pulls out. Still, good climbing technique should be handy in and around Leavenworth. Unfortunately, I am not good enough with my flutterkick to ever get away from Alcatraz. Marie\n\t\tand I have talked seriously of going to Bolivia, where we want to go anyway — but I am afraid I am too deep in this thing to take a powder. I would let down too many people. . . .\n\n\n\tOne last note: for those of you in the San Francisco area, there are two In the Sierra events scheduled in May. All of the details are here. \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Two New Directions Titles on the Best Translated Book Award Shortlist\n  \n  \n    The Nation on “Varamo” \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Brooke-Rose’s writing ranged from literary criticism to short stories,, but she is perhaps best known for her experimental novels, and the techniques of constraint she used to employ writing them (i.e. writing an entire novel without using the verb \"to be.\") In 1992, New Directions published Brooke-Rose’s Textermination — a novel about a gathering of famous literary characters at a San Francisco Hitlon who ponder their continued existence in the minds of contemporary readers.  \n\n\tYou can read her obituary in the New York Times here.  \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     The New Yorker on W.

It’s gotten attention from far and wide, including The Chicago Tribune, Time Out Chicago, The Economist, and The Millions. Having finally gotten my hands on a copy, I have to say that the praise is much deserved.\n\n\tI was in Chicago a few weeks ago and spent a couple of hours with J.C. Gabel, the magazine’s editor-in-chief and main driving force. At some point he asked if I’d seen pictures of their newsstand. When I told him I hadn’t, he pulled out his digital camera and showed me the pictures you see below. That is indeed an old fashioned (and portable) newsstand that they constructed themselves and which they set up in spots all over Chicago to sell their first issue directly to readers on the street. And yes, the pages decorating the newsstand are taken from a copy of Robert Walser’s Microscripts, sacrificed for the greater good. We of course think it’s a thing of wondrous beauty, and a tremendous compliment as well. So thanks, J.C. \n\n\t \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t \n\n\tBy the way, we’re doing a paperback edition of Microscripts — with illustrations by Maira Kalman — in the fall, which you can see in our latest catalog.  \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Three Percent on “Never Any End to Paris”\n  \n  \n    The New York Review of Books Excerpts “The Secret of Evil” \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Posted below is the first paragraph, but you can read the full piece here.\n\n\t\"I have been indebted to Jochen Greven my entire professional life. His name first entered my consciousness when I was seventeen: I had requested as a birthday gift Das Gesamtwerk by Robert Walser, which turned out to be a softcover boxed set published by Suhrkamp Verlag, each of its twelve volumes beautifully wrapped in linen, in a shade of forest-green I have associated with Walser and German literature ever since. Jochen Greven was the editor of those twelve meticulously annotated volumes, and of the fourteen-volume Kossodo Verlag edition that had proceeded it (published starting the year of my birth), along with many other editions of Walser’s work in the years and decades to follow…\" \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Harper’s Excerpt of “The Secret of Evil”\n  \n  \n    Three Percent on “Never Any End to Paris” \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Over the years he won several awards, including the Prix Médicis Etranger, the Aristeion, the Nossack, and the Europaeischer Staatspreis. Tabucchi’s books have been translated into more than forty languages and some of his novels have been adapted for the movies, directed by renowned directors like Roberto Faenza, Alain Corneau, Alain Tanner and Fernando Lopes.\n\n\tWhile traveling in Paris, he picked up a collection of poetry by Fernando Pessoa, which initiated a lifelong love affair with Portugal. He maintained a second in Lisbon, met his future wife there, and became Pessoa’s translator into the Italian.  \n\n\tHe taught at the University of Siena and lectured in many prestigious  universities abroad (Bard College in New York and the Ecole de Hautes Etudes and the Collège de France in Paris). Well known as a fierce critic of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, he wrote for many Italian and foreign newspapers (Corriere della Sera, L’Unità, Il manifesto, Le Monde, El Paìs, Diario de Noticìas, La Jornada, Die Allgemeine Zeitung) and cultural magazines such as La Nouvelle Revue Française and Lettre International.\n\n\tHe will be missed, but his spirt endures.  \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     n + 1 Video of Helen DeWitt\n  \n  \n    A Sneak Peek at Anne Carson’s New Book (the Real Thing!) \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

I think of DeLillo when I pass Great Jones Street; Millay when I pass what used to be St. Vincent’s hospital; Selby whenever I’m in Red Hook or near the Navy Yard; Pynchon whenever fleet week comes around; and so on and so forth. But the closest \"landmark\" is the White Horse Tavern, which sits only a few blocks from our offices at the intersection of the West Village, Chelsea, and the Meatpacking District. And each and every time I pass it I try to envision Dylan Thomas sitting at the bar, sipping a drink, alone, his eyes narrowing as the night wears on. I’m perhaps guilty or romanticizing the notion of the tortured, drunken writer, but the legend is simply too powerful. I also, every time, think of a verse by Tom Waits, in the song \"Lucinda\": \"I was standing outside the White Hourse, but I was afraid to go in.\" Is he referring to the White Horse on Hudson Street in New York, or some other bar, somewhere else, somewhere imaginary. Does it matter, really?  \n\n\tThe entry in The Way It Wasn’t — a collection of memories and memorabilia — on Dylan Thomas includes a heartbreaking memory from New Directions founder James Laughlin. He explains that when Thomas died, Laughlin and John Brinnin, Thomas’ American tour agent, flipped a coin to determine who would have to go to Bellevue to identify the body. Laughlin lost, identified the body, and then answered questions for a form. They wanted to know his profession, and so Laughlin told the young woman (\"She was about four feet high, and I don’t think she had even finished high school yet.\") that he was a poet, to which she replied, \"What’s that?\" \n\n\t\"He wrote poetry,\" he replied. The form ended up saying \"Dylan Thomas. He wrote poetry.\"\n\n\tSo, yes. I associate the White Horse Tavern with Dylan Thomas, with alcohol as the overarching theme. It’s how he’s remembered, sadly, but we bother to remember it because we still love his poetry. And it endures; gets me every time I read it. Take the two poems below, for example. The first is as spare as he gets, and yet the imagery of the poet at work, and of life going on around him while he works, is remarkably poignant without being even remotely saccharine or self-indulgent. And the second, which is about half of an unfinished poem given the title \"Elegy\" (printed in The Collected Poems), evokes those quintessentially Thomas themes: unflagging humanism, strength in the face of loss and defeat, confusion at the inability to live forever.\n\n\t\t\"In My Craft or Sullen Art\"\n\t\tIn my craft or sullen art\n\t\tExercised in the still night\n\t\tWhen only the moon rages\n\t\tAnd the lovers lie abed\n\t\tWith all their griefs in their arms,\n\t\tI labour by singing light\n\t\tNot for ambition or bread\n\t\tOr the strut and trade of charms\n\t\tOn the ivory stages\n\t\tBut for the common wages\n\t\tOf their most secret heart.\n\t\tNot for the proud man apart\n\t\tFrom the raging moon I write\n\t\tOn these spindrift pages\n\t\tNor for the towering dead\n\t\tWith their nightingales and psalms\n\t\tBut for the lovers, their arms\n\t\tRound the griefs of the ages,\n\t\tWho pay no praise or wages\n\t\tNor heed my craft or art.\n\n\n\t*    *    *\n\n\t\tFrom \"Elegy,\" an unfinished poem\n\t\tBeing innocent, he dreaded that he died\n\t\tHating his God, but what he was was plain:\n\t\tAn old kind man brave in his burning pride.\n\t\tThe sticks of the house were his; his books he owned.\n\t\tEven as a baby he had never cried;\n\t\tNor did he now, save to his secret wound.\n\t\tOut of his eyes I saw the last light glide.\n\t\tHere among the light of the lording sky\n\t\tAn old blind man is with me where I go\n\t\tWalking in the meadows of his son’s eye\n\t\tOn whom a world of ills came down like snow.\n\t\tHe cried as he died, fearing at last the spheres’\n\t\tLast sound, the world going out without a breath:\n\t\tToo proud to cry, too frail to check the tears,\n\t\tAnd caught between two nights, blindness and death.\n\t\tO deepest wound of all that he should die\n\t\tOn that darkest day.

Beloved by Roberto Bolaño as the antidote to Pablo Neruda, and the reason he’s on my mind lately (he’s mentioned repeatedly in Between Parentheses).\n\n\tI’m not exactly sure what I envisioned when I looked up his photograph, but I think it was something a bit more… revolutionary.

Whatever it was that I’d expected, it wasn’t the photo you see to the right.\n\n\tHe’s downright debonair. The shirt/sweater/ascot combination suggests a man who is very thoughtful about his wardrobe, very precise, and yet the slightly long, windblown hair suggests a man of the world, a man who enjoys a drink and a cigar at three in the morning - like the inspiration for XX’s \"Most Interesting Man in the World.\" And the eyes… whatever it is he’s looking at, he’s understanding it quickly and thoroughly — and also slightly dismissively. \n\n\tIn retrospect, this is exactly how I should have pictured him: knowing, exacting, and daring.  \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Fiction Advocate on Singing Caryatids\n  \n  \n    The Critical Mob Reviews “Hour of the Star” \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Of course I mentioned her previous book, Nox, and of course I ended up saying \"beautiful book-in-a-box\" dozens of times over the course of three days. Which led me to wonder (since I wasn’t here at New Directions when Nox was first published, and didn’t read every review of it) how the various reviewers chose to describe the physical nature of the \"book.\"  Below is a sampling of what I found.\n\n\t\n\n\t*   *   *\n\n\t\tWith \"Nox,\" she mixes form to such an extent that it’s hard even to call the finished product a book. It is, instead, a gray box containing a single sheet of heavy-stock paper, folded accordion-style and covered with text, old photographs, letters, illustrations and mementos.\n\t\tTime Out New York\n\t\tThe manuscript, housed in a box, is a single accordion-folded sheet, which the reader must unfurl slowly, page by page — it becomes clear that Carson aims to school her reader in patience when deciphering texts.\n\t\tKate Ringo, Virginia Quarterly Review\n\t\tA unique assemblage of bits of conversation, letters, postmarked stamps, memories, cut-up photographs, drawings, paint, staples, etc., \"Nox\" is here replicated as one long accordion foldout in a clamshell box.\n\t\tMark Gustafson, Rain Taxi\n\t\tThe book is most of all remarkable for its other forms of expression, the physical as well as the linguistic, including an individualist etymology of the poem’s every word, simultaneously professorial and passionate in a way that Catullus, that greatest of Roman innovators, might very plausibly have approved of himself. Opposite the left-hand pages, presented as part of a Latin dictionary, are childhood photographs, postage stamps and scraps of letters, the whole work connected in single sheet, a winding-sheet as it seems, contained in a solid-sided box.\n\t\tPeter Stothard, Times Literary Supplement\n\t\tThe book is an extraordinary object to behold, and more extraordinary to read, but it’s hardly accurate to even call it a “book.” It’s perhaps 10 feet of paper, folded accordionlike, displaying as near a reproduction of Carson’s original collage journal as is possible. The whole thing is folded and packed into a beautiful gray box:  the faded letters, the dog-eared corners of the photos, the awkward way all of it was held to the page with staples and glue.\n\t\tCraig Morgan Teicher, Publishers Weekly\n\t\tShe offers us a cardboard box containing a book. But what a book….It’s a book with pages you can turn. But all the pages are connected, in one long folded concertina. It’s a challenge, physically speaking, to read.\n\t\tJohn Timpane, Philadelphia Inquirer\n\t\t\"Nox\" (Latin for night) is not a collection in the ordinary sense, but a box containing a single long sheet of paper folded like a concertina. On one side of this sheet appear a collection of quotes, definitions, translations, letter-fragments, pieces of poetry, photographs, paintings, scribbles, and drawings.\n\t\tAndrew Motion, The Guardian\n\t\t\"Nox\" is unwieldy. It is, very deliberately, a literary object—the opposite of an e-reader designed to vanish in your palm as you read on a train. It comes in a box the size of my external hard drive, and its pages fold out, accordion-style, to colonize all your available space.\n\t\tSam Anderson, New York Magazine\n\t\tAnne Carson’s new book comes in a box the color of a rainy day, with a sliver of a family snapshot on the front. Inside is a Xerox-quality reproduction of a notebook, made after the death of her brother, including text and photographs and letters, pasted-in inkjet printouts, handwriting, paintings and collage. “Nox” has no page numbers, and it’s accordion-folded. It carries a whiff of visual art multiple or gift shop souvenir or “Griffin & Sabine.”\n\t\tBen Ratliff, The New York Times Book Review\n\t\t\"Nox\" doesn’t look or behave like any other book of poetry (or prose) out there. It’s not a book in the traditional sense; the usual binary of verso and recto is confounded by one long page that accordions out of a coffin-like box. But its physical shape isn’t the only thing that makes \"Nox\" so special; the text itself is an assemblage of words and images so artfully arranged that they make us reconsider not only what poetry can do — and should do — but even what a book is.\n\t\tAndrew Ervin, The Believer\n\t\tSharp-eyed readers will have noticed that there are no page numbers indicated above for \"Nox,\" an elegy for her brother by the highly esteemed poet and classicist Anne Carson. This is because Carson’s moving yet strikingly unconventional work arrives as a single accordioned sheet, folded into a handsome clamshell box — a kind of reliquary, perhaps.\n\t\tMichael Dirda, The Washington Post\n\n\n\t*   *   *\n\n\tThe last two (below) are my favorites; Chiasson’s because of his extended musing on the nature of \"accordion-fold\" books, and O’Rourke’s because she’s the only one to liken the box’s size to that of a Bible, and a specific version at that.  \n\n\t*   *   *\n\n\t\tCarson took a notebook and made a long book-collage of everything she’d collected. \"Nox\" is the facsimile of that strange homemade object. It is a most unusual book, printed on one side of a long single sheet of paper folded like an accordion. “Accordion-fold” books are their own minor genre, and are often homemade: folding a sheet of paper, first this way, then that, is among the simplest ways to make a book, requiring no binding. This chain-link form is especially suited to panoramas, alphabets, bestiaries, souvenir books, and almanacs. The format allows for the simultaneous representation of episode and arc, individual and ensemble: stretched out along the length of a table, you can see all at once the succession of English monarchs, or the stages of the evolution of man, or one hundred full-color views of Paris. \n\t\tDan Chiasson, The New York Review of Books\n\t\t“Nox” is as much an artifact as a piece of writing. The contents arrive not between two covers but in a box about the size of the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible. Inside is an accordion-style, full-color reproduction of the notebook, which incorporates pasted-in photographs, poems, collages, paintings, and a letter Michael once wrote home, along with fragments typed by Carson. The reproduction has been done painstakingly, and conjures up an almost tactile sense of the handmade original.

Following in the footsteps of many New Directions poets, Forrest is a Renaissance man with degrees in geology and literature. He’s written novels, poetry, and criticism, and has translated, as well. His most recent collection, Core Samples from the World, has been named a finalist for the 2012 NBCC Award in Poetry. \n\n\tThe collection is a collaboration with three photographers that travels the globe exploring the tension between the foreign and the familiar, and what emerges is an empathetic portrait of the world’s fundamental nature. To give you an idea of the unique structure Gander has created for the mixture of poetry and short essays, as well as the scope of landscapes, here’s the table of contents:\n\n\tOne:\n\tEvaporation\n\tA Clearing With photos by Raymond Meeks\n\tXinjiang: The Pamirs Poetry Journey\n\n\tTwo:\n\tEvaporation\n\tTinajera Notebook With photos by Graciela Iturbide\n\tMexico: A Core Sample through 24 Hours\n\n\tThree:\n\tEvaporation\n\tMoving Around for the Light, A Madrigal With photos by Lucas Foglia\n\tBosnia-Herzegovina: Life is Waiting\n\n\tFour:\n\tEvaporation\n\tLovegreen With photos by Raymond Meeks\n\tChile: Pigs of Gold\n\n\t*   *   *\n\n\tBelow are three poems, two from the second section, and one from the fourth.

As our creative director at-large, he’s been responsible for over two dozen beautiful covers over the past five years, including the new edition of Berlin Stories, last year’s Between Parentheses, and the entire Pearl series, just to name a few. \n\n\tBut Rodrigo is also a writer, and — along with co-author Jessica Anthony — has just published his first novel, Chopsticks. At the center of the novel is a young piano prodigy named Glory, who mysteriously goes missing one day. Through a variety of new and old forms of media (newspaper clippings, instant messages, videos, etc.) that are embedded in the novel (and brought to life in the iPad and iPhone versions) the reader develops a sense of what happened to Glory in the eighteen months prior to her disappearance from a mental hospital, where she’d been committed for obsessively playing “chopsticks.”\n\n\tWe don’t want to give too much away; you’ll have to experience it for yourself.\n\n\tOn behalf of everyone at New Directions, we’d like to say one simple thing to Rodrigo: Congratulations! \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     L Magazine on Albert Cossery\n  \n  \n    Poet of the Week: Forrest Gander \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Similar to Nox, this is a lovingly crafted and produced book. This time around, Carson has hand-lettered the text on the pages (see below), and artist Bianca Stone (a former student of Carson’s) has provided color illustrations (also below), which are being printed on translucent vellum pages. The end result being that the two will work together, the ghostly presentiment of the text-to-come enhancing the illustrations. \n\n\tThe translation itself is simply beautiful. She’s playful with the language and the plot (the chorus has a decidedly sarcastic tone; Kreon enters on a motorboat), and yet it’s still the fundamentally human story about death and honor, ethics and the law. It is, essentially what it was when it was written about 2500 years ago: a timeless classic. \n\n\tFirst, an example of the text alongside an illustration.\n\n\t\n\n\t*  *  *\n\n\tMore sample illustrations.\n\n\t \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Tennessee Williams’ New Orleans’ Haunts\n  \n  \n    New York Times Literary Supplement on “Lighting Rods” \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

While we were there, we took some time to find Faulkner House Books, a store in the heart of the French Quarter (with a very cool Pirate’s Alley address) where owner Joe DeSalvo, along with his wife Rosemary, specializes in all things literarily New Orleans. Faulkner wrote his first novel in the same building, hence the name, but Joe also knows plenty about Walker Percy and our favorite former New Orleans resident — Tennessee Williams. In addition to new and rare editions of our books, they also possess some correspondence between Tennessee and various friends, directors, actors, and our founder James Laughlin, along with the wonderful framed photograph you see below, which sits nestled between shelves of poetry. \n\n\tAfter we chatted with Joe and Rosemary for a while, Joe brought us around the corner to show us the building where Tennessee lived while he wrote A Streetcar Named Desire. In the picture below, it’s the large loft room on the top floor, and Joe told us that a restaurant used to occupy the second floor, and they gave him all of his meals. It being New Orleans, there’s a plaque on the building (also pictured).\n\n\tI couldn’t resist asking Joe if he knew where Tennessee had liked to do his drinking. Although one locale is now gone forever, he did point us to the Napolean House a few blocks away from the store on Chartres. The bar’s name, in case you’re wondering, comes from the original owner’s offer to house Napolean there if he ended up in exile in the Americas. Their house speciality is a Pimm’s Cup, which you see below sitting on their bar. A delicious drink. Alas, no one-armed hustler to be found.\n\n\t\n\n\t \n\n\t*  *  *\n\n\tWe also stopped in a wonderful used and antique bookstore called Crescent City Books. Not only did I find a rare copy of one of our New Directions quarterlies, I found this playbill for a Hanna Theater production of A Streetcar Named Desire directed by Elia Kazan and starring Anthony Quinn!\n\n\t\n\n\t*  *  *\n\n\tAnd then, on the way back to the hotel and all of the hubbub, I passed this little store, and couldn’t resist taking a picture. Tennessee’s legacy knows no boundaries.\n\n\t \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     The New Inquiry on “Satantango”\n  \n  \n    A Sneak Peek at Anne Carson’s New Book: ‘Antigonick’ \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Below is the printed version, and over on their website is a fancy multi-media version wherein Anderson talks about each note, including a defense/explanation of his \"LOL\" note in reference to a poem by Anne Carson. (It turns out he requires himself to actually laugh out loud and not just smile.)\n\n\t\n\n\t \n\n\tOnce I stopped smiling about the fact that three of the twelve selections were from New Directions titles (Birds, Beasts and Seas; Between Parentheses; and Lightning Rods), I started wondering why I stopped writing in the margins of the books I read. Before I get to any philosophical reasons there exists one rather practical reason: reading on the subway generally (unless you’re somehow lucky or sly enough to nab a seat) means holding a book with one hand and holding a pole with another, making the act of scribbling on anything just about impossible.\n\n\tBut that is not my reason. I think I stopped (and there was a time, certainly, when I scribbled and underlined extensively; the copy of Mrs. Dalloway that I read when I was twenty-two is covered in blue ink) when I began to realize that my tastes were changing over time, a fact that led me to foresee opening a book twenty years later only to be horrified by what I had to say about Susan Sontag as a naive young man. Perhaps I lack conviction in my tastes and opinions? \n\n\tLest I venture off on a personal and perhaps existential tangent, let me end by saying that Anderson’s act of sharing — and annotating, to make it sort of meta — his marginalia is a fascinating and thought-provoking little spread that I for one appreciated on my hungover New Year’s Day.   \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     The Awl Celebrates 75 Years of New Directions\n  \n  \n    The Millions on “The Hour of the Star” \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

I’ve said it before and will continue to do so for years to come, but it is an incredible honor to publish his work, and the day that the award was announced was both heartwarming and euphoric. \n\n\tJames Laughlin orginally published Tranströmer’s poetry back in New Directions in Prose & Poetry #19, from 1966. \n\n\t\n\n\tThe poem below can be found in The Great Enigma, the only English-language edition of his complete body of work. The collection was edited by Jeffrey Yang, whose favorite poem is one called \"Molokai.\" He had this to say about it and about Transtrômer:\n\n\t\tEach line is a seemingly simple declarative statement that presents a different perspective, or view. The first line a view from a cliff or hill above, looking down; the second line an imagined view from below looking back up; the third line turns back into the forest from where the speaker originally came from; the fourth a moment of stillness in the depths of the forest that shifts from image to a particular kind of silence; the fifth moves deeper into a forest that becomes a forest of individual memory; the sixth turns into the history of this place as shaped by a foreigner who once lived on the island, and cared for the sick and forgotten; the seventh makes a subtle comment about the mystery and beauty of faith and forgiveness. How the simplicity and rhythm of this little poem is able to evoke such emotional intensity I’ll leave for others to also dwell on. I will say that I have walked that same path and have returned to that sacred island and have seen those trees with long blue needles … and this poem has captured something remarkable and profound that, like all good poems, gets under your skin.\n\n\n\t\"Molokai\"\n\tby Tomas Tranströmer\n\ttranslated by Robin Fulton\n\n\t\tWe stand at the edge and deep down under us glisten the roofs of the leper colony.\n\t\tThe climb down we could manage but we’d never make it back up the slopes before\n\t\t     nightfall.\n\t\tSo we turn back through the forest, walk among trees with long blue needles.\n\t\tIt’s silent here, like the silence when the hawk nears.\n\t\tThese are woods that forgive everything but forget nothing.\n\t\tDamien, for love, chose life and obscurity. He received death and fame.\n\t\tBut we see these events from the wrong side: a heap of stones instead of the sphinx’s\n\t\t     face.\n\n\n\tIn conclusion, I’ll once again cede the podium to Jeffrey, who adds: \"Tranströmer’s poetic memoir, Memories Look at Me (just published this week), is also a kind of pure, alchemical distillation of memory. Its sentences seep into the brain slowly, each turn the unexpected awaits, as in the middle of the chapter about the poet’s grammar school days when we suddenly read, ’Many of the teachers were committed Nazis.’”\n\n\tCongratulations again.

Many of them are incomparably wonderful, and in what I hope will be a semi-regular feature on the blog, we’ll point them out to you.\n\n\t\n\n\tWith this installment of Awesome Author Photos, we present Clarice Lispector. New Directions recently published a new edition of her most famous novel, The Hour of the Star, in a new translation by biographer Benjamin Moser, who is also overseeing the publication of four new editions of Lispector’s work in May of next year (more on that below). And with today’s Vogue.com endorsement of The Hour of the Star, it seems apt to share the author photo to the right (perfectly suitable for Vogue’s glossy pages) along with a much-quoted line from the translator Gregory Rabassa, who once said that, when he met Lispector, he was \"flabbergasted\" to meet \"that rare person who looked like Marlene Dietrich and wrote like Virginia Woolf.\"\n\n\tCorroboration for the first half of the comparison is obvious in the photograph to the right. In fact, the same photo inspired designer Paul Sahre when we asked him to design the covers for the four forthcoming titles. Have a look:\n\n\t\n\n\t And as for the second half, superlative praise from the likes of Colm Tóibín, Orhan Pamuk, Jonathan Franzen, and Edmund White abounds.

The over-arching plot is what the title suggests: a history of the Long March, with Chairman Mao as the central character. But it isn’t linear, and there are several sections that break away from the plot entirely, many of them parodies of other writers, including Ernest Hemingway and Jack Kerouac. \n\n\tThe book was originally published in a shorter form in a magazine, Artist Slain, in 1969. It first appeared in its final format in 1971, published by Citadel Press. And part of their agreement included a requirment that the cover be designed by Roy Lichtenstein, a friend of Tuten’s. \n\n\tThe book’s many fans include John Updike and Susan Sontag. \n\n\tBut back to the writing itself. My favorite section is the final, in which the writer interviews Mao at his home (where, in addition to a staggering number of books and magazines stacked on tables, he has a poster bearing the infamous Che image on his wall). They discuss all sorts of things, with Mao proving himself to be very well-read and even tempered, if a bit firm in his opinions. It’s a sublte characterization, one that can be read and re-read over and over.\n\n\tI’ve always particularly loved the discussion on Jean-Luc Godard, which comes up because of his 1967 film La Chinoise. One little pearl is this exchange, beginnning below with that is the tail end of a long response from Mao to a one-word question about which Godard movies Mao has seen and liked:\n\n\t\tMao: Godard’s contradictions are wholesome and accurate with regard to his condition in bourgeois culture. But films like Made in U.S.A. or La Chinoise show him uncertain in his instincts. He is now the Oscar Wilde of cinema imagery.\n\t\tI: Do you object to the satire on youth in the film \"La Chinoise\"?\n\t\tMao: Yes. For satire must never be directed against the class whose aspirations you share—only the enemy.\n\n\n\tThe Oscar Wilde of cinema imagery. Interesting. I’d also like to add that Made in U.S.A. happens to be my favorite Godard movie, so Mao and I disgaree on this point (among many others). I could go on an on about this section, but will stop here and instead say that I hope to see you all Sunday afternoon at the Jane Hotel for the marathon reading. Rumor has it that a Mao puppet will make an appearance.  \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Poet of the Week: William Carlos Williams the Translator\n  \n  \n    Vogue Recommends Clarice Lispector \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Rather than showcasing poetry by the inimitable (and, some would argue, quintessentially American) poet William Carlos Williams, we’re going to share some of his translations of poetry from the Spanish. Williams grew up in a Spanish-speaking household (his mother was Puerto Rican) and considered himself half-Spanish. Beginning in the second decade of the 20th century, he began translating poetry from Spain and Latin America, and saw these translations as a way of presenting unknown Spanish poets to an American audience (sound familiar?). He also believed that they helped extend the range of American poetry, a mission that was ever-present in his own poetry.\n\n\tBelow are four translations from By Word of Mouth: Poems from the Spanish, 1916-1959. The collection was compiled and edited by Jonathan Cohen, who had this to say about the book and the poems here:\n\n\t\tIt expands his established canon in a really big way, adding previously unknown work and also work that hasn’t yet been properly recognized as his. More than that, in bringing these translations together, it shows in full force his many Hispanic personae, which collectively span his entire poetic life. These translations are dramatic masks that he wore in the performance of poetry, to render Spanish-speaking voices in his beloved American idiom, with the stamp of his own personality. Here are four of them just right for this time of the year in New York, where from New Directions’s office you can see out across the Hudson River to the rooftops of Rutherford, New Jersey, where Williams lived and composed them.\n\n\n\t\"Cancion\"\n\tby Lupercio de Argensola\n\n\t\tThe tired workman\n\t\tTakes his ease\n\t\tWhen his stiff beard’s all frosted over\n\t\tThinking of blazing\n\t\tAugust’s corn\n\t\tAnd the brimming wine-cribs of October.\n\n\n\t \n\n\t\"Ode to My Socks\"\n\tby Pablo Neruda\n\n\t\tMaru Mori brought me\n\t\ta pair\n\t\tof socks\n\t\tthat she knitted with her own hands\n\t\tof a shepherdess,\n\t\ttwo soft socks\n\t\tyou’d say they were rabbits.\n\t\tIn them\n\t\tI stuck my feet\n\t\tas in\n\t\ttwo\n\t\tjewel cases\n\t\twoven\n\t\twith threads of\n\t\ttwilight\n\t\tand lamb skins.\n\t\tViolent socks,\n\t\tmy feet were\n\t\ttwo fish\n\t\tmade of wool,\n\t\ttwo long sharks\n\t\tof ultramarine blue\n\t\tshot\n\t\twith a tress of gold\n\t\ttwo gigantic blackbirds,\n\t\ttwo cannons:\n\t\tmy feet\n\t\twere honored\n\t\tin this manner\n\t\tby\n\t\tthese\n\t\tcelestial\n\t\tsocks.\n\t\tThey were\n\t\tso beautiful\n\t\tthat for the first time\n\t\tmy feet seemed to me\n\t\tunacceptable\n\t\tlike two decrepit\n\t\tfiremen, firemen\n\t\tunworthy\n\t\tof that embroidered\n\t\tfire,\n\t\tthose luminous\n\t\tsocks.\n\t\tNevertheless\n\t\tI resisted\n\t\tthe acute temptation\n\t\tto keep them\n\t\tas schoolboys\n\t\tkeep\n\t\tfireflies,\n\t\tor the erudite\n\t\tcollect\n\t\tsacred documents,\n\t\tI resisted\n\t\tthe furious impulse\n\t\tto put them\n\t\tin a cage\n\t\tof gold\n\t\tand to feed them\n\t\tevery day\n\t\tbird seed\n\t\tand the pulp of rosey\n\t\tmelon.\n\t\tLike discoverers\n\t\twho in the forest\n\t\tyield the very rare\n\t\tgreen deer\n\t\tto the spit\n\t\tand with regret\n\t\teat it,\n\t\tI stretched out\n\t\tmy feet\n\t\tand pulled over them\n\t\tthe\n\t\tbeautiful \n\t\tsocks\n\t\tand\n\t\tthen my shoes.\n\t\tAnd this is\n\t\tthe moral of my ode:\n\t\ttwice beautiful\n\t\tis beauty\n\t\tand what is good is twice\n\t\tgood\n\t\twhen it is two socks\n\t\tmade of wool\n\t\tin winter.\n\n\n\t \n\n\t\"Naked\"\n\tby Álvaro Figuerdo\n\n\t\tThe azure yielder\n\t\tof the skylark’s way or the foam\n\t\tceaselessly re-created\n\t\tmade into ultimate marble\n\t\tthere where the mediterranean\n\t\tnavel imposes\n\t\tits majesty and casts\n\t\tprecious strokes of gold upon cheeks\n\t\tadvanced by Sirius between\n\t\ttwo breasts that give\n\t\thard commands to the wind\n\t\tasleep in the blue shepherding\n\t\tslowness between her thighs\n\t\tnow that I part them a siesta to see her\n\t\tstrictly disciplined horizontals\n\t\tcrowds forges vineyard country\n\t\tinstant shadows glaciers\n\t\tblueblue cocks\n\t\tof weather vanes when\n\t\ttheir noble bellies isolate\n\t\tthe flow of the ocean as\n\t\tthe young huntress sleeps\n\t\tand a birch tree quickens upon her knees.\n\n\n\t \n\n\t\"Conversation with My Father\"\n\tby Eugenio Florit\n\n\t\tClearly you already know it\n\t\tyou already know it all\n\t\tknow it all clearly.\n\t\tBecause of this you know too\n\t\thow I wish to tell it,\n\t\tfor while I speak I am recalling\n\t\tas I sit here beside you:\n\t\tI writing\n\t\tand you silent beside me.\n\t\t…Well, since you left\n\t\tmany things have happened…\n\t\tMen have died and been born,\n\t\tgrown ill and recovered,\n\t\tfelt well, taken their\n\t\tsup of soup, piece of fish,\n\t\tgot up, gone into the sun\n\t\tlike cats to the window.\n\t\tOthers do not get up\n\t\tbut remain stretched out\n\t\tand die.\n\t\tDie like you,\n\t\tand others, men and women,\n\t\tand all that you love\n\t\tand all those who follow you.\n\t\tAlthough many still live.\n\t\tThey keep living, despite weeping and mourning.\n\t\tAnd one day they want to go\n\t\tfor a walk, to go to the movies,\n\t\tto play the piano much as you do.\n\t\tNot that in this way I bury you deeper;\n\t\tbut that, more living, they remember you more.\n\t\tBecause they live with you, with what you enjoyed\n\t\tin your books.

Silva\n\t\tthat your brother Pepe once brought\n\t\tfrom the other side.\n\t\tYes, it would be fine\n\t\tto wander again through so many rooms—except\n\t\tthe little French things of the 18th century, so silly,\n\t\tand the English women with their buttery flesh.\n\t\tAnd then go into the park\n\t\tand sit down to talk at our ease\n\t\tobserving how at sunset the air\n\t\tmoves rippling the lighted waters of the pool.\n\t\tYou already know how the war came about\n\t\tand how in it people died;\n\t\tand how the war ended\n\t\tand how the people’s mania followed it\n\t\tbent on destruction, killing\n\t\tas if all the maceration of the flesh were not enough.\n\t\tAnd we learn nothing.\n\t\tAnd it is sad to think that all this agony\n\t\tcould simply disappear\n\t\tif man could learn to wipe the grin from his face,\n\t\tand to say one good word, truly,\n\t\tand wish, in fact, to make life noble.\n\t\tBut he does not want it, as you see.\n\t\tWhat he wants is to follow\n\t\tthis overwhelming dance of death\n\t\twhich is not your death nor mine\n\t\t—that is to say, death as it may happen\n\t\tabout the house, one that is met in slippers\n\t\tor at most in the open country\n\t\tor in clear water,\n\t\twithout the other, heaped up mountainous\n\t\tin stinking fields and foul waters,\n\t\tdeath which drops from the air\n\t\tand comes from hiding\n\t\tto crush

cold\n\t\t—to the day it leaves me in eternity cold.\n\t\tAnd that which would be the last of my worries.\n\t\tThat which worries me most is to be blinded or maimed\n\t\tunable to see a day full of sunlight\n\t\tnor hold a rose in my fingers\n\t\tfor the eyes have fallen into a pit of darkness\n\t\tthe fingers remain dried up like burlap.\n\t\tI say, that if we are to see, it means nothing to me.\n\t\tBut the inquisition of having to be seated\n\t\tin those metal chairs or made of I don’t know what,\n\t\twith glass mirrors where you may not sit\n\t\twhich are not on the walls and the window,\n\t\tbut mirrors where plates and cups are set\n\t\tand glassware on the tables instead of wood,\n\t\tso that you have to keep looking at the skirts of the ladies,\n\t\tthat yes, is more inquisition than the bomb.\n\t\tWhen you left, all of this had hardly begun,\n\t\tbut now…\n\t\tI tell you I yearn to go into an old curtained house\n\t\twith rugs on the floors\n\t\t(but real ones, not those made of wood-fiber and synthetic silk)\n\t\tand wide comfortable chairs\n\t\t(so as not to be seated as if out of courtesy\n\t\ton hollow metal stuck into our hams)\n\t\tand lamps like those which thank God\n\t\tI have at home\n\t\t(and like those others\n\t\tfound in funeral parlors\n\t\tor hotel lobbies, lamps, yes, which give light\n\t\tbut cast no shadow).\n\t\tAnd the worst is that is pleases people to have it\n\t\tthis way, and there are those\n\t\twho tear up a whole marble fireplace in their homes\n\t\tto replace it with an idiotic artifact\n\t\tembodying a thermostat and air control and\n\t\tI don’t know what else,\n\t\tbut which, since there is no visible flame,\n\t\tgives off heat without light\n\t\tand since there is no light there are no shadows\n\t\tshadows for the half closing of the eyes\n\t\tto quit reading and turning the page,\n\t\tto quit reading with half vision\n\t\tshadows to redirect the wavering eyes\n\t\tand refocus them on the word\n\t\twhich awaits us at the end of the strophe.\n\t\t(With all this, father,\n\t\tyou will say that I am growing old;\n\t\tand you’ll be right.\n\t\tAt my years I prefer\n\t\tto go home and hang up my overcoat and hat,\n\t\tand to take a cup of tea with lemon in it\n\t\tor chocolate beside the window.\n\t\tSince thank God I am not cold,\n\t\tI tranquilly allow the cat\n\t\tto do whatever he pleases.\n\t\tAnd if the question of a cat hot or cold\n\t\tis beside the point,\n\t\tthe question for us, you and me, and whoever else\n\t\tis to pass the time reading.)\n\t\tLet us turn to other things,\n\t\tin my opinion, you are well off up there.\n\t\tDid you finally go to your own Castilian land\n\t\tas I thought you would?\n\t\tYou must have enjoyed meeting\n\t\tso many friends\n\t\tand stopped to talk with  them\n\t\ton some Cuban threshing floor at midday.\n\t\t(There will be those who will think this an error\n\t\tfor they do not know of the little town that you loved;\n\t\twhere, as soon as I can, will go to ashes.)\n\t\tBut to change the subject,\n\t\tyou would be amused\n\t\tto see how your son\n\t\tthe poet has turned painter\n\t\t—of course only to put down mere nonsense.\n\t\tBecause, as you well know\n\t\t—now I recall those little green mountains\n\t\tand those blue skies that you painted in tempera\n\t\tfor the Nativity scenes you made for us at Port-Bou—\n\t\tI say, as you know,\n\t\tit is something very amusing\n\t\tto daub a canvas with paint\n\t\twithout knowing whether it is going to be flowers or a gorilla.\n\t\tWith me it is mostly monsters\n\t\tbut I hope some

You know I never leave you;\n\t\tthat to stop talking is not to quit you,\n\t\tI take myself off, but still listening,\n\t\tI am with you when I leave you…\n\t\tI mean…that I do not go, leaving;\n\t\tbut let me finish this letter\n\t\tthough I am seated beside you forever.\n\t\tFor when I stop talking to you, I continue to talk.\n\t\tWell, I am making a botch of it, but you understand.\n\n\n\t \n\n\t\t \n \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Jonathan Franzen Channels Tennessee Williams&#8230; via a Chair\n  \n  \n    “The Adventures of Mao on the Long March”: A Primer \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Many of them are incomparably wonderful, and in what I hope will be a semi-regular feature on the blog, we’ll point them out to you. \n\n\tToday we present William Gerhardie, an Anglo-Russian writer who was championed by such lauded figures as Evelyn Waugh and H.G. Wells, but who seems to have disappeared almost entirely from the culture radar, at least on our side of the pond. Well, to that I say, have a look at the picture on the right. \n\n\tAs far as I’m concerned, any writer who can pull off that hat-and-jacket combo (and in my opinion, he does) deserves to have his name burrowed into any decently well-read individual’s mind. \n\n\tOriginally written in 1922, while Gerhardie was still in college, New Directions published a new edition of his first novel, Futility, in 1991. It draws heavily on his own experiences in pre-Revolutionary Russia and seems — I confess I haven’t read it yet myself — to have been written in a comic-nihilist tone, which was of course echoed later in the century by everyone from Samuel Beckett to Joseph Heller.  \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     From Our Library: “New Directions 22”, Featuring Richard Hell Before He Was Richard Hell\n  \n  \n    Jonathan Franzen Channels Tennessee Williams&#8230; via a Chair \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

And he has undoubtedly inspired legions of lesser-known punk and hardcore bands. And hopefully still is.\n\n\tBut prior to joining The Neon Boys, he’d dropped out of high school and moved to New York (from Kentucky) to become a poet. In addition to writing under a pen name — along with future bandmate Tom Verlaine, as a sort of combined character — he was also published under his given name: Richard Meyers.

Act II features a video of Franco playing the Gentlemen Caller from The Glass Menagerie, while a series of actresses audition for the role of Laura via karaoke. And in Act III  male actors will audition for the role of Tom, with Franco and co-star Laurel Nakadate playing directors, producers, and possibly a certain writer. \n\n\tSo far so good; Franco has proven to be quite good at channelling the icons of yesteryear, and we are all in favor of meta-plays about Tennessee. But the head-scratching portion of the play is actually in Act I, when Franco and Nakadate \"will lead a séance with an invited group of special guests to communicate with Tennessee Williams through a Ouija board and receive instructions from the author’s spirit.\" \n\n\tI admit I’m a little curious about the invited group of special guests (John Waters?), but the important part of that sentence is the fact that they’ll communicate with Tennessee Williams through a Ouija board! Personal beliefs (or lack thereof) in the supernatural aside, I do hope this works out. Godspeed, Mr. Franco. \n\n\tTickets are sold out, of course, though you can get on a waiting list. Luckily the co-sponsor, Paddle8, will have video of the performance on its website later that same night. I fully expect the spectre of Tennessee to be in his Sunday best. \n\n\t[Update]\n\n\tThe L Magazine was at the performance and has a write-up here. The audience, it seems, tended towards \"cynical, snickering disbelief.\"  \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     The New Yorker on Helen DeWitt\n  \n  \n    Vol. 1 Brooklyn on “Lightning Rods” \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

During one of many conversations about Occupy Wall Street, someone mentioned Che’s famous U.N. speech, which made me think of this picture:\n\n\t\n\n\tSimone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Che Guevara.

And for the last forty or so years, we’ve been in the same 19th floor space on 14th Street in Chelsea, which means that a lot our history is still here, happily reminding us of the past. Our library contains (nearly) every first edition of every book we’ve ever published, many of them well-handled and worse for the wear, but still bearing the iconic covers designed by Alvin Lustig. Our Executive Vice President has maintained a collection of (nearly) every catalog from over the years, and you could easily lose track of time leafing through their yellowing pages, delighting at seeing what James Laughlin had to say about a then-new novel by Nabokov.\n\n\tAnd then there’s this beautiful piece of craftsmanship:\n\n\t\n\n\tIt’s a copper printing plate for the cover of the previous edition of Louis-Ferdinand Céline’s classic Journey to the End of the Night. I found it just sitting on one of Jeffrey Yang’s cluttered shelves. As I examined it, he explained that a few years back, a former employee had been looking to clear up space in the production manager’s office and had simply thrown a bunch of these away! I was speechless. Apparently the witticism is true: Nostalgia isn’t what it used to be. \n\n\tTo the left is a copy of a book printed using that plate. The design is by Brownjohn, Chermayeff & Geismar, and there’s a note saying that it’s \"adapted from a World War I battle map of France.\" The rectangular hole, of course, was for the moveable typeset copy, the first line of which reads:\n\n\t\tFuture historians, charting the disintegration of social forms in our age, will find paramount expression of this revolt in the novels of Louis-Ferdinand Céline.\n\n\n\tSo thanks to Jeffrey for saving this one. He told me that a few other employees snatched souvenirs, too, but the vast majority of them are long gone, buried in Staten Island somewhere. Alas.  \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Harvard Crimson on “Tres”\n  \n  \n    Tony Kushner in The New Yorker, Discussing Tennessee Williams \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

Weinberger and Davis, having known eachother since highschool, exchanged humorous comments about who was the \"cooler kid\" back in the day before settling ito read. Coincidentally, both authors had a similar trajectory to their readings: three or four short new pieces followed by a much longer \"poem essay.\" Whether this had been planned in advance by the two old friends, whose to say? But in style and interest, both writers carved their own niches. Ms. Davis focused on everyday encounters and people portraits, and her poem essay described a village in pilgrim America. Mr. Weinberger weaved stories such as a small Indian village’s wedding rituals into almost Aesopian fables. His poem essay was a tribute to the lost birds of paradise. There was a rhythm to the readings that lent an air of enchantment to the evening keeping the audience hushed and attentive. You can watch Eliot Weinberger reading from a new piece above.     \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Siri Hustvedt on Susan Howe on Emily Dickinson\n  \n  \n    n+1 Interviews Helen DeWitt \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

I’m told 900 people were in attendance, and judging by the pictures here, I’m inclined to believe them. I was there, sitting near a column, my view of the stage almost entirely blocked, but I could see the podium. The presenters were asked to read from their favorite book of the last forty years, and although event coordinator Stephanie Valdez managed to keep their selections under wraps until the day of the reading, she did tip me off to the fact that both Paul Auster and Siri Hustvedt (who live nearby and are frequent customers) would be reading from New Directions books!\n\n\tFirst, Mr. Auster read from George Oppen’s New Collected Poems after providing a beautiful biography of Oppen’s fascinating life. Ms. Hustvedt was later in the program, and she read from Bollinger Prize winner (and Blaney lecturer) Susan Howe’s book My Emily Dickinson. Alas, as far as I know there isn’t any video footage, so you’ll have to trust me when I say that any time you can see them read and talk about poetry, jump at the chance.\n\n\tI can, however, share the following with you. These are Ms. Hustvedt’s introductory remarks about Susan Howe and her book, reproduced from the notes she gave me after the event:\n\n\t*  *  *\n\n\tMy Emily Dickinson is a critical, scholarly, poetic, subversive, mordant, brilliant book written by the poet Susan Howe. It is by far the best work about our greatest poet I have ever read, and I have read many.\n\n\tIt is not easy to read from this book, as Howe’s sentences are sometimes dense. She plays with the poet’s play. Dickinson’s poems come and go unannounced. Howe is so deeply immersed in Dickinson’s language and in the multiple sources of that inimitable language that the reader must be attuned to Howe’s particular kind of erudition, a form of knowing that refuses to bow to the conventions of literary criticism, but more importantly, she resists the very idea of binary oppositions, hot and cold, high and low, man and woman. Meanings are not fixed. They slide.\n\n\tThe book’s epigraph is from William Carlos Williams’s In the American Grain, a work that foreshadows My Emily Dickinson.\n\n\tI will read the epigraph, Howe’s first sentence, and then part of a section called \"Identity and Memory.\" I would like to stress that Howe’s insights about the lot of a woman writing are relevant now. The cheap platitudes and truisms of our culture, which proclaim that although women writers may once have suffered from condescension by the patriarchal powers-that-be, they no longer do, is utter bunk. Things have changed, and they have stayed the same.\n\n\t*  *  *\n\n\tThe epigraph, in case you’re curious:\n\n\t\tIt is the women above all — there never have been women, save pioneer Katies; not one in flower save some moonflower Poe may have seen, or an unripe child. Poets? Where? They are the test. But a true woman in flowe, never. Emily Dickinson, starving of passion in her father’s garden, is the very nearesy we have ever been — starving.\n\t\tNever a woman: never a poet. That’s an axiom. Never a poet saw sun here.\n\n\n\t(William Carlos Williams, In the American Grain)\n\n\tAnd Howe’s first sentence:\n\n\t\tMy book is a contradiction of its epigraph. \n \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     The Los Angeles Review of Books on “Between Parentheses”\n  \n  \n    Video of Eliot Weinberger Reading at KGB Bar \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

She says:\n\n\t\tIt had been 18 months since my first agent told me she could get an advance so I could finish writing Samurai; instead I had had well over a year of unsolicited advice. I couldn’t look at the book, thought I would never write again. And this funny voice started talking in my head. I love the innocent bad taste of The Producers—I think “Springtime for Hitler” is a work of genius—and this had something of the same feeling about it. I discovered recently that Mel Brooks also created Get Smart, and that his breakthrough was to have the hero of a sitcom who was not very bright; this seemed to offer similar comic potential.\n\n\n\tIf you’ve read Lightning Rods, you’ll immediately see the connection. Although the novel isn’t as over-the-top as the video above (and really, what is?) it definitely offers a healthy dose of satire. As the New York Observer’s Molly Fischer put it: \"The subtle absurdities and indignities of office life don’t interest Ms. Dewitt. It’s the always-selling, all-American, self-perpetuating love of innovation that Lightning Rods more effectively mocks.\"\n\n\tAs with any well-executed work of satirical art, there’s a tendency to take the page-to-page plot a little too seriously, to forget that something is being spotlighted and perhaps glorified precisely in order to be mocked. And so it’s important to set-up the satire, to set the right tone, which Helen does early in the book when she lets readers deep into the screwy fantasy world of Joe, whose sexual fantasies involve a bizarre game show that reminds me of those old Chuck Barris-produced shows like \"The Dating Game\", \"The Gong Show\", or \"The Newlywed Game\". \n\n\tTo wit:\n\n\t\tAnother fantasy was about a game show with three contestants with their upper bodies sticking through a hole in a wall. In the first part of the game, one contestant was penally challenged from behind. Panelists had to guess which. The contestants got points if the panelists guessed wrong. An inset in the screen showed the thrusting buttocks of a man giving the contestant the old Atchison Topeka. In the second stage of the game, any number could be involved, from zero (though this had never happened in the whole time he’d been watching the show), right on up to a full house (this was actually surprisingly common). The panelists had to guess how many, and which ones.\n\n\n\tHow’s that for setting a proper tone?  \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     The New York Observer Reviews “Lightning Rods”\n  \n  \n    The Los Angeles Review of Books on “Between Parentheses” \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

We were giddy, of course. Beside ourselves. There’s nothing quite like the Nobel Prize to remind you — to reassure you — that what you do on daily basis on behalf of all of these brilliant writers and poets matters tremendously, and in turn that a great many people find enormous value in literature. \n\n\tThere were requests for comments and interviews, and there were phone calls and emergency meetings as we scrambled to reprint copies of The Great Enigma (it’s flattering and heartwarming, by the way, to know that so many people are so anxious to get their hands on his poetry), but we also received an incredible number of phone calls and emails (and even some champagne!) congratulating us. Now, we’re very proud of having published Tomas as far back as the 1960s, and to publish the only complete collection of all of his writing available in English, but all of the credit and congratulations should go to two people. First, to translator Robin Fulton for his years of dedication to The Great Enigma. And of course to Tomas Tranströmer himself, who is so eminently deserving of this honor. So, from across the ocean and six time zones, we’d like to raise our glasses and offer this simple toast: \"Congratulations, you deserve this.\" \n\n\tAnd I couldn’t resist including this picture, a screengrab from a Swedish newspaper’s site. According to a friend in Sweden:\n\n\t\tThey opened their door to a swarm of journalists who each year come to their place (hoping that he’ll win) and at first they were taking pictures of just Tomas, but then his Monika kneeled down next to him and he put his arm around her, and everyone continued to take pictures like crazy.\n\n\n\t \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Joe Strummer + Allen Ginsberg = Arthur Rimbaud (and methadone kitties!)\n  \n  \n    The Boston Globe Reviews “Lightning Rods” \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

The best song on the album, however, is probably “Straight to Hell,” a haunting and generally underappreciated song that should be recognizable to fans of M.I.A, who sampled the opening guitar and drum riff in her popular hit “Paper Planes”.\n\n\tBut there’s also no denying the sublime beauty of another of the album’s darker songs: “Ghetto Defendant.” If you aren’t familiar with it, watch the video above, courtesy of the film Rude Boy.\n\n\tRecognize that voice reciting poetry? I didn’t. I had no idea who it was for years, was never even curious. But when I finally looked it up, it turned out to be none other than Allen Ginsberg. As an excuse I’ll just say that my musical curiosity far outpaced my literary curiosity as a teenager, meaning that although I knew who Allen Ginsberg was, I had never heard his voice and never would have guessed that he, of all people, was friendly with Joe Strummer. Of course now it makes perfect sense. Strummer’s lyrics were just as politically charged as Ginsberg’s poetry, and both were living icons at the time. A perfect match, ideologically. The risk came in having a poet speak in slow, even-toned lines in between Strummer’s passionate lyrics. The end result? I don’t think it’s everyone’s cup of tea, and I’m not always in the mood for it myself, but it’s hard not to smile at such enjoyable lines as “Do the worm on Acropolis / Slam dance cosmopolis” or “Methadone kitty / iron serenity.”\n\n\tBut this post is about Rimbaud, who makes an appearance at the 2:55 mark. For those of you who aren’t fans of The Clash (blasphemy!) and don’t want to bother listening, the lines Ginsberg reads are:\n\n\t\tJean Arthur Rimbaud\n\t\t1873 Paris Commune\n\t\tDied in Marseille\n\t\tBuried in Charleville\n\t\tShut up in eternity\n\n\n\tVolumes of biographies have been written about Rimbaud, and justifiably so. His lifestyle, his poetry, and his subsequent decision to stop writing poetry at a very young age have turned him into legendary figure. There was even, let us not forget, a really awful movie (Total Eclipse) made about him and Paul Verlaine, with young Leonardo DiCaprio playing Rimbaud. But Ginsberg’s slow recital (it spans over forty seconds of song time and plays second fiddle to Strummer’s chorus), and the mournful delivery of his conclusion, do about a good a job as is possible  — in only sixteen words — to memorialize Rimbaud. A respectful tip of the hat to Messieurs Ginsberg and Strummer. \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     Bookforum Absolutely Loves Helen DeWitt’s “Lightning Rods”\n  \n  \n    A Toast to Tomas Tranströmer \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

The official book launch is \n\t7 pm tonight at McNally Jackson, New York. \n\n\n\tA woman sits at a desk writing an account of her life. The desk is in Moscow. This is the third time in her life she's been asked to write an account of it, and it's entirely possible that this written account will put an end to her life, possible that this piece of writing will be transformed, if you will, into a weapon to be used against her. It's also possible that this piece of writing will be kept in reserve and that from the moment she turns it in she'll be obliged to live up to it, or to prove herself worthy of it, or else confirm the darkest suspicions that might arise from it. In the last case, the words she's writing here would also—after a brief or protracted delay—be something like a misdiagnosed illness that eventually, inevitably, would kill her. Didn't her husband always say that in the theater there's never a gun hanging on the wall that isn't going to be fired off at some point? She remembers Ibsen's \n\tThe Wild Duck and how she wept when the shot was finally fired. But perhaps she'll succeed—after all that's why she's sitting here, her one hope, and the reason she is taking such pains to find just the right words—perhaps she'll succeed in writing herself a way out, in extending her life by means of a few letters more or less, or at least making her life less onerous; there's nothing left for her to hope for now than to succeed in using her writing to write her way back into life. But what are the right words? Would a truth take her farther than a lie? And which of the many possible truths or lies should she use? When she doesn't even know who will be reading what she writes? There's only one thing she doesn't assume: that this piece of writing will be nothing more than a sheet of paper with ink on it, slipped into a folder and forgotten. In a country in which every child and every cleaning woman and every soldier can recite poems by Lermontov and Pushkin from memory, that would not be likely.\n\n\n\t7 pm tonight: New Directions presents Jenny Erpenbeck in conversation with Susan Bernofksy, moderated by Jenny Hendrix at McNally Jackson.

A celebrated poet, musician, and visual artist, he is also an autodidactic scholar and philosopher.  His work incorporates ideas from metaphysics, non-Euclidian mathematics, music theory, and politics, recomposing them into something poetical and personal beginning with language itself. In his bok of poems The Sri Lankan Loxodrome, Will uses real locales to introduce the reader to a geographical fantasia, guiding his reader through floating veils of meaning, both tactile and surreal. Will has been invited to read in many places across the US, and will be reading from and discussing his work as part of the event “A Question of Africa: Will Alexander—Toward the Primeval Lightning Field,\" a panel discussion that will be held on December 9 at the CUNY Graduate Center in New York City.\n\n\n\tI had the pleasure of corresponding over email with Will about his use of geography—both physical as well as spiritual—that permeates his work.\n\n\n\t* * *\n\n\n\tElizabeth Bryant: You were born in Los Angeles and have chosen to live your life there. How often, if ever, do you have Los Angeles in your mind when you are writing?\n\n\n\tWill Alexander: Let me say, first off, I am not a Los Angeles provincial. But I've needed the cultural resources of a global capital, and Los Angeles is a global capital. Its cinema, museums, and libraries, its cultural fertility has been crucial in my development as a poet.\n\n\n\tEB: How has your relationship changed with the city over time?\n\n\n\tWA: Los Angeles remains a susurrate catalyst for my work. To me, it cannot be privately hoarded or provincially compressed, or didactically extolled according to a previously constructed American narrative. It continues to rise and shape itself as a global presence and as a vector for the powers of otherness outside the English language. A few days ago, for example I engaged in an extended exchange with a gentleman from the Ivory Coast and had another with a friend from Mexico. This type of spontaneous cultural exchange is a very common experience in this city. As an African-American male, I also bring an otherness to these exchanges, since the African-American presence remains a foreign element within the governing American narrative. But as we spoke, this narrative was notably absent. What I'm emphasizing here is that a  whole new cultural identity seems to be transpiring in Los Angeles according to the tenets of the unforeseen.\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\tEB: Many of your works, like The Sri Lankan Loxodrome and Asia & Haiti, concern places far from Los Angeles. Where have you traveled over the course of your life, and what places have made the most significant impressions on you?\n\n\n\tWA: For me, the most vivid form of travel has been in situ, not unlike Raymond Roussel spawning imaginary realms from seeming occlusion. If it's \"the Sri Lankan Central Hills\", or “the Gulf of Gonâve\" in Haiti, or \"Yamdrok Lake\" in Tibet, they are not literal configurations of the stated locales, mind you, but in the context of the writing they rise as imaginary nodes, or points of raised significance at crucial junctures in my work. Therefore, what I write is never tainted by verbal tourism, rather it is psychically involved with this geography, allowing it to shift via seepage into the \"differential.\" In short, a geography that partakes in what Henri Corbin called mundus imaginalis.\n\n\n\tEA: Tell me a little about your creative process in regard to your visual art. What is the relationship between your artwork and your poetry?\n\n\n\tWA: The visual art and the written art both arise, for me, like flora and fauna. They ignite from the same invisible wellspring yet phenotypically differ. In my work this invisible energy enters into both the writing and the visual work. In my case, I call the written work energy of the right hand, and the visual work energy of the left hand. Thus the artwork is symbiotic with the writing. Yet I do not draw something in order for it to fit with something already written. When an image is drawn, it is akin to applying words but more instantaneous, more hypnotic. If I have any dictum it must be paraphrased thus: All imaginative creation must invoke itself as energy, which remains spontaneously feral.\n     I am also concerned with what the Tamil philosopher Anada Coomaraswamy called “the picture which is not in colours\", realized in my practice of using language that I feel has a certain cellular electricity. A level no longer bound by exoteric meaning, but language which internally registers as alchemical energy. A language organically unpredictable, yet always internally balanced.\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\tEB: I've noticed that you often choose the British spelling of words over the American. The word “vapour,\" for instance, appears throughout the collection spelled with an “ou.\"\n\n\n\tWA: I've been prone to British spelling since I saw the word “colour\" as a child. So when I started to publish my poems it felt very natural for me. I guess to maybe some individuals it may seem as something exotic. But what I can say is that for me, it adds texture to the text, which allows the text to emit a more complex savor.\n\n\n\tEB: You have developed a formal style of including a glossary at the end of your works. I've noticed some of the words you choose to elucidate are imaginary terms like “goatfish burin.\" Others are archaic, technical, or specialized, for instance “globigerina,\" (shells of falling radiolarians). Yet others of a similar nature go unannotated. How do you choose which words upon which to expand, and which to leave “unsupervised\"?\n\n\n\tWA: My glossaries are not meant to serve as mechanical handrails for the reader. They help orient him or her to a higher dimension of my language. If I took an accountant's approach, more and more words would be listed; the result would be something all together tedious and scholarly.\n\n\n\tEB: How does orientation affect how your poems are read aloud?\n\n\n\tWA: The poem is not aurally dependent upon glossaries or any extrinsic structuring agency. It naturally emits a vibration, which is audibly intelligent to the listener over and beyond any cognitive aspect. I call it primordial vibration.\n\n\n\tEB: What are you currently working on with your poetry?\n\n\n\tWA: I have five books due in the ensuing months. Two are collaborations— one with the visual artist Byron Baker titled The Codex Mirror, and another book with New York poet Carlos Lara inspired by Breton and Soupault's The Magnetic Fields called The Audiographic As Data. A book of my early writings, Aboriginal Salt:Early Divinations, will by published by the Detroit press White Print. There's more than the above, but I'll only mention one more project—it concerns Muslim polymaths during the age of the Moors. The book revolves around Dar el-Hikma, an institution founded in Cairo in 1004, that foreshadowed Cambridge, Bologna, and Salamanca, and the modern university.\n\n\n\t* * *\n\n\n\tElizabeth Bryant is a writer living in Brooklyn. \n\n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n      \n     A Desk in Moscow\n  \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

In Spanish with simultaneous translation.\n\n\n\tGeneral admission: $10 | ICNY Members: $5You may purchase the tickets over the phone (212-308-7720), at ICNY (before 6:30PM the day of the event) or online\n\n\n  \n    \n      Instituto Cervantes\n    \n  \n  \n            \n      \n        211-215 East 49th Street\n        \n        New York, NY  10017\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Website \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n              \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n  \n\n      \n     \n      \n\n\n      \n     César Aira in Conversation with Rivka Galchen\n  \n  \n    César Aira in Conversation with Hari Kunzru \n  \n\n\n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

He urged me to finish Harvard and then do 'something' useful.\" Intended \"as a place where experimentalists could test their inventions by publication,\" the ND anthologies first introduced readers to the early work of such writers as William Saroyan, Louis Zukofsky, Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, Kay Boyle, Delmore Schwartz, Dylan Thomas, Thomas Merton, John Hawkes, Denise Levertov, James Agee, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Soon after issuing the first of the anthologies, New Directions began publishing novels, plays, and collections of poems. Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams, who once had difficulty finding publishers, were early New Directions authors and have remained at the core of ND's backlist of modernist writers. And Tennessee Williams first appeared as a poet in the early Five Young American Poets.\n\n\n\tAlthough New Directions started in the service of verbal revolution, it also reprinted Henry James, E.M. Forster, Ronald Firbank and Evelyn Waugh when other publishers would not; when no one would print F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Crack Up, ND did; when The Great Gatsby was out of print, New Directions brought it back. New Directions has published nearly 20 of Henry Miller's unorthodox essays and travel books and first printed James Joyce's Stephen Hero, Herman Hesse's Siddhartha, and brought back into print books of such importance as Gary's Promise at Dawn, Henry Green's Back, Joyce Cary's Second Trilogy, and Nathaniel West's Miss Lonelyhearts. This tradition is carried on today in our series of New Directions Classics. Begun in 1981, this series has brought back works by Sherwood Anderson, Kay Boyle and H.E. Bates, among many others, and introduced works by little-known European masters such as Eça de Queirós, Krleza, and Kosztolányi.\n\n\n\tIn the spring of 1993 ND introduced the Bibelot series of short, self-contained \"gems\" from the backlist such as Henry Miller's A Devil in Paradise, poems by Pound and W.C. Williams, together with reissues of short modern classics such as Muriel Spark's The Abbess of Crewe. These inexpensive, pocket-sized volumes serve as introduction to the great modernist authors of the twentieth century.\n\n\n\tIn addition, ND has relaunched many classics recently with introductions by contemporary authors: these include Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire (Introduction by Arthur Miller) and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Introduction by Edward Albee), John Hawkes' Second Skin (Introduction by Jeffrey Eugenides), and John Gardner's October Light (Introduction by Tom Bissell).\n\n\n\tInterested in issuing influential foreign writers in translation, (often in bilingual editions), New Directions has been largely responsible for America's interest in Céline, André Gide, Apollinaire, Yukio Mishima, Italo Svevo, Tommaso Landolfi, Rainer Maria Rilke, Kafka, Octavio Paz, Eugenio Montale, Lorca, Nabokov, and most recently W.G. Sebald, Javier Marías, Roberto Bolaño, Inger Christensen, Uwe Timm, Yoko Tawada, Antonio Tabucchi, Bei Dao, and Victor Pelevin. And from Britain — E.M. Forster, B. S. Johnson, and H. E. Bates.\n\n\n\tThe handsome color jackets featuring abstract designs for which New Directions was known in the 1950s were the work of designer Alvin Lustig. In order to give ND books a distinctive look in the early days of the paperback, Lustig suggested switching to black-and-white covers exclusively, which for many years was a house trademark. The colophon of the centaur was designed from a statue by Heinz Henghes sculpted in the 1930s.\n\n\n\tNew Directions was honored in 1977 with a Carey Thomas Award special citation for distinguished publishing in poetry and experimental prose. Its authors have won the Nobel Prize (Frédéric Mistral, Eugenio Montale, Pablo Neruda, Saint-John Perse, Octavio Paz, José Camilo Cela), Pulitzer Prize (Richard Eberhart, Selected Poems 1930-1965; George Oppen, Of Being Numerous; Gary Snyder, Turtle Island; Tennessee Williams, A Streetcar Named Desire; William Carlos Williams, Pictures from Brueghel), MacArthur Foundation Fellowship (Walter Abish, Allen Grossman, and Ralph Manheim, translator), PEN/Faulkner Award (Walter Abish, How German Is it?; Toby Olson, Seaview), Neustadt International Prize for Literature (Octavio Paz, Kamau Brathwaite), American Translators Association Prize for German Literary Translations (Breon Mitchell, translator of Martin Grzimek, Heartstop), Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize (Denise Levertov), and The Present Tense/Joel H. Cavior Literary Award (William Herrick, That's Life), among others. New Directions authors inducted into the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters include Robert Creeley, James Laughlin and Gary Snyder. James Laughlin was the recipient of the American Academy and Institute Award for Distinguished Service to the Arts, the Annual P.E.N. Publisher Citation, and the National Arts Club Medal of Honor for Literature. In 1980, he was the first winner of the New York State Arts Council James Laughlin Award for distinguished achievement in independent publishing. Laughlin passed away in 1997.\n\n\n\tNew Directions now publishes about 30 books annually in hardcover and paperback.\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

We simply do not have the resources to properly assess the enormous amount of work submitted to us. New Directions is understaffed and we need all our resources to continue to publish books. We wish we could manage to read all the unsolicited manuscripts with the care that they deserve, but we cannot. We will make an effort to answer all brief queries, but please bear with us as we try to respond.\n\nPublicity\n\nTo request advance or review copies of any of our titles, please include your affiliation and provide online links to your work (if available). We try to fulfill these requests as quickly as possible, and will let you know if we have any questions. \n\nAll media inquiries should also be made through our publicity department.\n\nOur publicity director can be reached at publicity@ndbooks.com. \n\nBookstores\n\nIndependent bookstores can now be in touch with New Directions directly, through our Bookstore Liaison, Tom Roberge.

Written permission is required if you wish to reproduce any material.\n\nRequests must include all relevant information for the selection: book title, author, page number(s), title of poem or chapter (if relevant). We will also need information on your planned publication: the title, author or editor, publisher, proposed publication date, price, the edition's print run, the territories in which you plan to sell your book, and a return mailing address. You may include other information as you see fit.\n\nIt will take approximately two months to receive a response to your request.

In most cases, a permission fee will be charged.\n\nPlease submit your permissions inquiries to: permissions@ndbooks.com\n\nDesk & Examination Copies\n\nWhen requesting a desk copy please submit — from an official university email account, and in the body of the email — the name of the professor, course name, and expected enrollment, as well as the title, author, and 13-digit ISBN of book you would like a copy of. Allow up to three weeks for these requests to be processed. No attachments, please. \n\nPlease submit your requests to deskcopies@ndbooks.com.\n\n*Desk Copies CANNOT be sent directly to a professor's home.\n\nEmployment\n\nThere are currently no open positions at New Directions.  \n\nInternships\n\nNew Directions offers full- and part-time college internships on a rolling basis in our Manhattan office. In your cover letter please clearly indicate your desired start date. Each internship lasts between one and four months in order to accommodate school schedules.\n\nProspective interns must have completed their sophomore year in college. Applicants are encouraged to negotiate with their college registrar's office to receive academic credit for their internships. At this time the internship pays $15 per day for lunch and daily travel expenses.\n\nDuties consist primarily of office work: answering phones, sorting and sending mail, copying, filing, and organizing. On occasion, some editorial and publicity work may be involved, but applicants should bear in mind that most of the chores tend to the clerical. Previous office experience is preferred but not mandatory. \n\nTo apply: Send a cover letter stating your interest in New Directions, along with your resume, to editorial@ndbooks.com. No phone calls, please.\n         \n  \n\n  \n\n      \n      \n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      About Us\n      History\n      Staff\n      Contact\n    \n    \n      Follow Us\n      Facebook\n      Twitter\n      YouTube\n    \n    \n      Resources for\n      Booksellers\n      Professors\n      Media\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tNew Directions was founded in 1936, when James Laughlin (1914 - 1997), then a twenty-two-year-old Harvard sophomore, issued the first of the New Directions anthologies. \"I asked Ezra Pound for 'career advice,'\" James Laughlin recalled. \"He had been seeing my poems for months and had ruled them hopeless.

The Musical Brain & Other Stories is the first collection of his stories to appear in English and comprises twenty tales about oddballs, freaks, and crazies. Aira, with his fuga hacia adelante or “flight forward” into the unknown, gives us imponderables to ponder and bizarre and seemingly out-of-context plot lines to consider, as well as thoughtful and passionate takes on everyday reality. The title story, published in the New Yorker, is the enterpiece of this exhilarating collection of characters, places, and ideas—the crème de la crème of Aira’s many short stories.\n        \n        \n        \n      \n      \n       more information  \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n         \n          \n\n\n\n \n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n          Adventures in Immediate Irreality \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Fiction\n         \n        \n          Adventures in Immediate Irreality, the masterwork of the Romanian writer Max Blecher, vividly paints the crises of “irreality” that plagued him in his youth: eerie unsettling mirages wherein he would glimpse future events.
