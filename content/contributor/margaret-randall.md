Margaret Randall was born in 1936 in New York City. When she was eleven her family moved to New Mexico. She attended the University of New Mexico for one year and then returned to New York where she became heavily involved with the Beat Generation, the Black Mountain poets and the Abstract Expressionists. In 1961, she moved to Mexico City. She spent nine years in Mexico where, with Sergio Mondragón, she co-founded and co-edited a bilingual literary magazine, _El Corno Emplumado / The Plumed Morn_. In 1968, the Mexican student movement and the Oct. 2 massacre at Tlatelolco profoundly changed her life. During 1969, she, her four children, and her companion, Robert Cohen, removed to Cuba where they now live and work. Margaret Randall’s work has appeared in many U.S., Latin American and European magazines. She has published several volumes of poetry: _25 Stages of My Spine_, _Water I Slip into at Night_, _So Many Rooms has a House but One Roof_. In Cuba, she works for the Book Institute at its Social Sciences Publishing House, for which she recently completed a comprehensive book on Cuban women, _La Mujer Cubana Ahora_. At present she is preparing a book on American Indians for the Institute.
