Since the appearance in 1992 of _Hygiene de l’assassin_, an overnight bestseller in France, Belgian novelist Amélie Nothomb (1967- ) has become a literary phenomenon worldwide, translated in twenty-six languages and awarded numerous prizes. She was born in Kobe, Japan in 1967 to diplomat parents and spent her childhood in Bangladesh, Burma, Laos, New York, and China. She now lives in Brussels and Paris and once held the world record for the fastest descent from Mount Fuji: 3,776 meters in forty minutes.
