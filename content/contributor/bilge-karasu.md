Bilge Karasu (1930–1995) was born in Istanbul and became the pre-eminent Turkish modernist writer. Besides short stories and novels he was also a well-known translator. A graduate of the philosophy department of the Faculty of Letters of Istanbul University, Mr. Karasu worked in the foreign broadcast department of Radio Ankara until a Rockefeller University scholarship made it possible for him to continue his studies in Europe. After returning to Turkey, he went to work at Hacettepe University, where he lectured in philosophy. In 1963, Mr. Karasu won the Turkish Language Institute’s Translation Award with Olen Adam, for a translation of D. H. Lawrence’s _The Man Who Died_. By that time, he had begun to experiment with new forms of expression in his collection of stories entitled _Troya’da Olum Vardi_ (Death in Troy). He won the Sait Faik Story Award eight years later with _Uzun Surmus Bir Gundu Aksami_ (Evening of a Long Day). By the beginning of the 1980s, he had tried an abstract form of expression in _Gocmus Kediler Bahcesi_ (The Garden of Departed Cats) and incorporated other forms of art into his writing. He attempted different uses of form and content in works he styled "texts" rather than "stories." His other works include _Kismet Bufessi_ (Kiosk of Destiny), a collection of short stories; and _Kilavuz_ (The Guide).
