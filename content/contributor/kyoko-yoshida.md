Kyoko Yoshida's first collection of short stories _Disorientalism_ came out in 2014 from Vagabond Press in Sydney. She was born and raised in Fukuoka, Japan, studied in Kyoto, got her Ph.D. in creative writing at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and after 13 years of teaching at Keio University in Tokyo, now teaches American Literature at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto.

In 2005, she was a honorary fellow at the International Writing Program at University of Iowa, and in 2006-07, a visiting fellow at the Program for Literary Arts at Brown University.

She translates from and into Japanese: from Japanese, contemporary experimental Japanese poetry and drama; and into Japanese, contemporary fiction. _Spectacle & Pigsty: Poetry by Kiwao Nomura_ (OmniDawn, 2011, with Forrest Gander) won the 2012 Best Translated Book Award in Poetry in the US and the 2012 Toson Memorial Rekitei Award in Japan. Other poets and playwrights she has translated or co-translated include Masataka Matsuda and Shu Matsui. Her translations of fiction include novels by Dave Eggers.
