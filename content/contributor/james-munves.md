The author James Munves (1922â€“ ) obtained his degree in English from Brown University. From 1970 to 1973 he lived in Colombia, home to more bird species than anywhere else in the world, where he wrote his manuscript of _Andes Rising_. Although the manuscript was finished in the 70s it was not published until 1998 when Munves stumbled upon it in his old files. Author of a number of books on history and contemporary issues, he has published short stories in various magazines including _Confrontation_ and _The New Yorker._
