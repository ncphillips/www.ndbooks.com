Carlyle Ferren Macintyre (1890–1967), said of himself: "My background includes the Scotch Highlands, the bluegrass hills of Kentucky and as much of Europe as I could get at various times." His mother was a student of Latin and Greek but she taught him to read Baudelaire early; his father was more interested in France and Egypt, and he read aloud to his son most of the world’s classics. In late adolescence MacIntyre made many canoe and sailing trips, usually alone. He also did about 5,000 miles of hoboing. He took a Ph.D. at the University of Marburg, where he fell under the spell of Gothic architecture, plainsong and stained glass. MacIntyre was also an American poet known for his poetry and his translations of Baudelaire, Verlaine, George, Goethe and Rilke. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship (1938) to translate Goethe’s Faust, and received two separate Fulbright Scholarships (1948, 1953) to continue his translations. Macintyre taught at UCLA and Berkeley. He died in Germany in 1967.
