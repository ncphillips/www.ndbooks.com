René Char (1907–1988) was a French poet. After the publication of a book of his poems, he moved to Paris and joined the surrealists, along with Louis Aragon, André Breton, and René Crevel. In 1940, he joined the French Resistance under the name Captain Alexandre, an experience he wrote about in the prose poems Feuillets d’Hypnos. He died of a heart attack in 1988.
