After receiving his management degree from  École des Hautes Études Commerciales de Paris, he worked for two years in London at L’Oréal, the cosmetics company. During his time there, he began to write and eventually completed his highly-acclaimed _Annam_, which earned him, at only twenty-one years old, France’s prestigious Prix du Premier Roman.

Upon returning to Paris, Bataille changed jobs and began working in publishing, at Grasset, and he continued to write by night. Since January 2007, he has supported Bibliothèques Sans Frontières (Libraries Without Borders) a young non-governmental organization devoted to helping to provide help in educating citizens of developing countries.
