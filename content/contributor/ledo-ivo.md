Ledo Ivo (1924–2012) was a Brazilian journalist, poet, novelist, and essayist. He was born in Maceió, Alagoas, Brazil as the son of Floriano and Euridice Placido de Araujo Ivo. He later married Maria Leda Sarmento de Medeiros and fathered Patricia, Maria da Graca and Goncalo. Ivo’s first volume of poems—_As Imaginações_—granted him national recognition in 1944. Since then he has written several other works of poetry including _Ode and Elegy_, _Ode to Twilight_, _Birth of the Sonnet_, _Language_, and _The Common Soldier_. His novels include _Alliances_, _The Road without Adventure_, and _The Death of Brazil_. Early in Ivo’s career he rejected the stylistic innovations of modernism in favor of classical forms and rhythms, yet his poetic creations exhibit a broad range of themes in language. Ivo once said: "I live by writing, but I sometimes envy people who live their lives remote from art, distanced from the words and materials which engender the creation of poetry—people who are simply absorbed by the very pattern of life."
