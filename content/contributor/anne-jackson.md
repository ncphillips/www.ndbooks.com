In 1926, Anne Jackson was born in Millvale, Pennsylvania, a town set on the Allegheny River opposite Pittsburgh. Her family was forced to relocate to New York City during the depression so that her father could find a means to support them, a feat he achieved as a barber. On arriving in New York, the family first lived in an abandoned windmill in Brooklyn before finding their way to a tenement on Liberty Avenue.

Jacksonâ€™s fascination with theatre and film began in those early days of New York and continued to deepen as she made her way onto Broadway with a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse, where in 1943 she began to study full time. She earned parts in Broadway and Off-Broadway productions, performing in several plays by Tennessee Williams, including _Summer and Smoke_ and _The Property is Condemned_, during which she met her future husband, a fellow Playhouse actor, Eli Wallach.

Later in her career, Jackson appeared in film and television. Her screen credits range from _The Shining_ to _Law & Order_. She has now been married Wallach for over 65 years and currently teaches at a theatre arts non-profit organization, HB Studio in Manhattan.

Jackson is featured as a Contributor to [_Mister Paradise and Other One Act Plays_](http://ndbooks.com/book/mister-paradise-other-one-act-plays) by Tennessee Williams.
