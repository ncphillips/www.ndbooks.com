Danilo Kiš was born in 1935 in Subotica, on Yugoslavia’s border with Hungary. His works available in translation in the U.S. include three novels, _Garden_, _Ashes_, _The Hourglass_, and the _Encyclopedia of the Dead_. Starting in the mid-1970s, he lived mostly in France. He was awarded the Golden Eagle of the City of Nice and, just before his death in Paris in 1989, American PEN’s Bruno Schulz Prize.
