Purushottama Lal (August 28, 1929–November 3, 2010) was an Indian poet, essayist, translator, professor and publisher. His translations from Sanskrit have included a number of other religious works, as well as plays and lyric poetry. In 1958, Lal founded the publishing house, Writers Workshop, in Calcutta. Writers Workshop has published many contemporary Indian literary authors into the English language, including Vikram Seth, Pritish Nandy, and Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni. P. Lal spent a lifetime translating the Indian epic _Mahabharata—_the world’s longest poem—into contemporary English. He died before completing the final section, "Anushashana Parva."
