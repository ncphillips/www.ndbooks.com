Helen DeWitt was born in a suburb of Washington, D.C. in 1957. Her father joined the Foreign Service in 1960, and she grew up primarily in South America. She has a B.A. in Literae Humaniores and a D.Phil. in Greek and Latin Literature from the University of Oxford. Her first novel, _The Last Samurai_, was published in 2000 by Talk Miramax Books and subsequently in nineteen other countries. A Guggenheim Fellowship (2006â€“7) supported work on _Risk_, a novel incorporating the information design of Edward Tufte (in progress). She has collaborated with the painter Ingrid Kerma on the show "Blushing Brides," with journalist Ilya Gridneff on the novel _Your Name Here_, with photographer Emily Horne on "Sexual Codes of the Europeans" for _Photography & Prose_ (under curation), and with artist Elizabeth McAlpine on "Plantinga" for _Photomonth Krakow_.
