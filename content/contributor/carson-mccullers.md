One of America’s most unforgettable literary figures, Carson McCullers (1917–1967) wrote with strength and compassion about life’s outcasts, their need to belong and their often isolated and anguished lives in such works as _The Heart is a Lonely Hunter_, _Reflections in a Golden Eye_, _The Ballad of the Sad Café_, and _The Square Root of Wonderful_.
