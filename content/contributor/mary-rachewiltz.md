Mary de Rachewiltz (1925– ) is an American poet and translator. She is the daughter of Ezra Pound and the violinist Olga Rudge. Though raised in Italy by foster parents, she frequently visited her father as a child. Rachewiltz married the Egyptologist Boris de Rachewiltz in 1946—the same year her father was deported to the U.S. to stand trial for treason. In 1971 her autobiography, _Discretions_, was published and she is also the author of several books of poems in Italian and English. Rachewiltz translated several of her father’s works including _The Cantos_. She served for years as curator of the Ezra Pound Archives at the Beinecke Library at Yale University. Rachewiltz lives in Italy with her husband.
