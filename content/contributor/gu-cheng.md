Gu Cheng (1956â€“1993) was born in Beijing, China. In 1978, Gu Cheng became involved with _Jintian_, a magazine that became the center for the "Misty Poets," a group of modernist poets who wrote "misty" or "obscure" poetry. Gu Cheng was exiled, along with other Misty Poets Bei Dao, Duo Duo, and Yang Lian, in 1989 after the Tiananmen Square protests. He died in 1993.
