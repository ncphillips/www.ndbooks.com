Eli Wallach was born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in 1915, the son of Polish Jewish immigrants. After serving in the US Army in World War II, he received his formative stage training at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York. He made his Broadway debut in 1945, in the short-lived play _Skydrift_, and soon won a Tony Award, in 1951, for his performance as Alvaro Mangiaco in the _The Rose Tattoo_ by Tennessee Williams.

Wallach leapt to film with another Tennessee Williams masterwork, _Baby Doll_ (1956), and from there his career on the screen endured through the second half of the 20th century, well into the 21st. He appears in classics such as _The Godfather III_ (1990), _Mystic River_ (2003), and Roman Polanskiâ€™s _The Ghost Writer_ (2010).

Throughout his career, Wallach has received Tony, Emmy, and BAFTA awards. In 2010, he received an Honorary Academy Award for his long and outstanding contribution to the performing arts.

He is featured as a contributor to [_Mister Paradise & Other One Act Plays_](http://ndbooks.com/book/mister-paradise-other-one-act-plays) by Tennessee Williams.
