Federigo Tozzi (1883–1920) was a realist writer, a follower of Gabriel D’Annunzio and Giovanni Verga, and was himself a major influence on Alberto Moravia, who held his work in the highest regard. In twelve years, he wrote 120 short stories, five novels, two books of poetry, as well as plays, many essays, and piles of drafts, notes, and letters. He died suddenly of the Spanish flu.
