Édouard Dujardin (1861-1949), French novelist and playwright, wrote extensively and edited the journal Revue Indépendente. When his parents passed away in 1882, they left him their fortune, which he used to finance productions of his plays. Over the years he also worked as a journalist, which frequently got him in trouble with the authorities. He passed away in 1949.
