Kenneth Rexroth (1905–1982) was an American poet, translator, essayist and social critic who played a key role in the San Francisco Renaissance of the 1950s and 1960s. His poems are characterized by such an unusual range of concerns that he often began his poetry readings by wryly asking the audience: "Well, what would you like tonight: sex, mysticism or revolution?" Though almost entirely self-educated, his erudition was astonishingly broad-ranging, as reflected in essays on topics as diverse as ancient Chinese science, modern jazz, American Indian songs, California mountaineering, medieval mysticism, avant-garde art and utopian communities. He connected with New Directions from the very beginning, and was both friend and adviser to James Laughlin for the rest of his life. New Directions published most of his books of poetry, including _Collected Shorter Poems_ (1966), _Collected Longer Poems_ (1968), and _Selected Poems_ (1984); his plays _(Beyond the Mountains_, 1951); his _Autobiographical Novel_ (1964; expanded edition, 1991); several collections of essays (_Bird in the Bush_, 1959; _Assays_, 1961; _World Outside the Window: Selected Essays_, 1987; _Classics Revisited_, 1986; _More Classics Revisited_, 1989); and numerous volumes of translations, including _100 Poems from the Chinese_, _100 Poems from the Japanese_, _Women Poets of China_, _Women Poets of Japan_, and _Selected Poems of Pierre Reverdy_.
