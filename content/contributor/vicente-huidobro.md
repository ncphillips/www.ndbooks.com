Vicente Garcia-Huidobro Fernandez (1893–1948) left Santiago in his early twenties, arriving in Paris in 1916 where he co-founded the influential Cubist magazine _Nord-Sud_ with Guillaume Apollinaire and Pierre Reverdy. Soon after, he launched his own poetic movement known as Creacionismo and wrote as well, for a score of other avant-garde journals. Author of over forty books—plays, political tracts, novels, manifestos, journalism, and poetry—Huidobro worked with Edgard Varese, Hans Arp, Juan Gris, Robert Delaunay, Jorge Luis Borges, and other important artists of his time.
