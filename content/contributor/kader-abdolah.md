Kader Abdolah is the pen name of Hossein Sadjadi Ghaemmaghami Farahani. Opposed to the rule of the last shah and that of the ayatollahs who followed, Abdolah was forced to leave Iran as a political refugee in 1988. He now lives in Holland and writes in Dutch, and lept to literary fame after 2005’s _House of the Mosque_. That novel, _My Father’s Notebook_ (2000), and _The King_ (2014), have appeared in English, and he has been acclaimed as "moving and illuminating" (_Publisher’s Weekly_), "captivating and distinctive" (_TLS_), "poignant and colorful" (_The Economist_), and "clean and lyrical" (_Kirkus Reviews_).
