Robert Lax was born in 1915 in Olean, New York. At Columbia University he studied with Mark van Doren and there began friendships with classmate and poet Thomas Merton, and painter Ad Reinhardt. After Columbia he worked as a university lecturer, film critic, script writer, and an editor for _The New Yorker_. Through the 50s, he traveled in Europe as a "roving editor" for _Jubilee_, a Catholic magazine, and _PAX_, while contributing to various anthologies and magazines. In 1962 he moved to the Greek islands, where he lived until his death in 2000.
