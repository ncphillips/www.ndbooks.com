Antonio Tabucchi was born in Pisa in 1943 and died in Lisbon, his adopted home, in 2012. The son of a horse trader, he studied literature and philosophy before taking up writing himself. Over the course of his career he won France’s Medicis Prize for _Indian Nocturne_, the Italian PEN Prize for _Requiem_, and the Aristeion European Literature for _Pereira Declares_. A staunch critic of Italian ex-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, he once said that "democracy isn’t a state of perfection, it has to be improved, and that means constant vigilance."
