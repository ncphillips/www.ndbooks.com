A crucial architect of literary Modernism, American poet Ezra Pound (1885–1972) looms over 20th-century cultural history.

In the early teens of the 20th century, he was the heart of a seminal network, exchanging ideas between American and British authors. In 1912 he was hired as a regular contributor to Harriet Moore's _Poetry_ and wrote as well for Wyndham Lewis's _BLAST_. From 1917 he was the London editor of _The Little Review_. Pound coined Imagism, a school of poetry in part derived from the clarity and economy of classical Japanese and Chinese poetry and he generously promoted writers such as Marianne Moore, H.D., Yeats, Joyce, Hemingway, Wlliam Carlos Williams, and T.S. Eliot. By the 1920s, he was actively promulgating the notion of one world of literature, encouraging translation from around the globe and across millenia. He himself translated extensively and is a noted and notably pithy essayist (see _ABC of Reading_, _Guide to Kulchur_, _The Classic_ _Noh Theater of Japan_, et al). His own work culminated in the monumental _Cantos_, an encyclopedic mastepiece of great poetic beauty.

Born in Hailey, Idaho, Pound attended the University of Pennlsyvania, where he met his lifelong friends William Carlos Williams and Hilda Doolitle (or H.D., as he suggested she sign her poems). In 1908 he set off for Europe, and published at his own expense, _A lume spento_, his first book. He followed with _Exultations_ (1909), _Personae_ (1909), _Provenca_ (1910), _Canzoni_ (1911), _Lustra and Other Poems_ (1917), _Hugh Selwyn Mauberley_ (1920), _Umbra: Collected Poems_ (1920), _Cantos I–XVI_ (1925), _A Draft of XXX Cantos_ (1930), _Homage to Sextus Propertius_ (1934), _The Fifth Decade of Cantos_ (1937), _Cantos LII-LXXI_ (1940), _The Pisan Cantos_ (1948), _Patria Mia_ (1950), and _The Cantos_ (1972).

In 1914 Pound married Dorothy Shakespear and in 1921 moved to Italy. There he became engaged in Fascist politics, and for his radio propaganda against the United States during the war, he was arrested for treason in 1945. In 1946 he was declared mentally ill and committed to St Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C., where he was held for a dozen years. Despite his political crimes, he was awarded The Bollingen Prize for his 1948 _Pisan Cantos_. After a lengthy campaign by fellow writers and his publisher James Laughlin of New Directions, he was released in 1948, returned to Italy, settled in Venice and into near complete silence, and died in 1972.
