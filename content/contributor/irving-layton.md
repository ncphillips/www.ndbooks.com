Irving Layton (1912–2006) was a Romanian-born, Canadian poet. Early in his life, Layton faced anti-Semitism growing up in the St. Urbain Street neighborhood of Montreal. Politically outspoken, he was a familiar face on the CBC’s _Fighting Words_ political talk show. Layton was a mentor to Leonard Cohen, who gave a eulogy at Layton’s funeral.
