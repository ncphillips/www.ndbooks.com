Pierre Reverdy (1889â€“1960) is one of the great figures of twentieth century French poetry, significant both for the intrinsic quality of his work and for his influence on the modern movement. A contemporary of the Cubist painters and Surrealists, he was in touch with both groups, but far closer, as we see him now in perspective, with the Cubists.
