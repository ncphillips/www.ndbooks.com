Nobel Prize Laureate and beloved Swedish poet Tomas Tranströmer (1931–2015) was born in Stockholm and worked as a psychologist. He wrote ten collections of poems that the Nobel Prize Committee praised for their “condensed, translucent images that give us fresh access to reality.” New Directions publishes his complete poems in one volume titled _The Great Enigma: New Collected Poems_. Tranströmer was first published by New Directions in 1966, in _New Directions in Prose & Poetry #16_. The best-known Scandinavian poet of the postwar period, and the most widely translated, his other books available in English include _Selected Poems 1954–1986_; _The Half-Finished Heaven_; _For the Living and the Dead_; _Night Vision_; and _Windows and Stars_. For many years after being seriously debilitated by a stroke, Tranströmer continued write. He was also an avid pianist and released a recording of classical piano pieces performed with his left hand. Tranströmer received numerous public recognitions for his poetry including the Neustadt International Prize for Literature, the Bonnier Award for Poetry, Germany’s Petrarch Prize, the Bellman Prize, the Swedish Academy’s Nordic Prize, the August Prize, and a Lifetime Recognition Award in 2007 from The Griffin Trust. In 2011 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.
