Jules Laforge (1860-1887) was a French poet born in Uruguay. He moved to France in 1866 to attend school. Beginning in 1881, he spent five years as French reader to the empress Augusta of Germany. He retired in 1886, returned to Paris and married, but soon after came down with tuberculosis and passed away in 1887.
