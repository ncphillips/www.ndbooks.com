Peter Glassgold’s most recent books are _Anarchy! An Anthology of Emma Goldman’s Mother Earth_ (Counterpoint, 2012) and the experimental translation _Hwæt! A Little Old English Anthology of American Modernist Poetry_ (Green Integer, 2012), both new and enlarged editions of works published respectively in 1985 and 2001. Forthcoming from New Directions is _The Collected Poems of James Laughlin 1935–1997_, which he has edited, annotated, and introduced. His previous books include: James Laughlin’s _Byways_ (New Directions, 2005), the posthumous verse memoir by New Directions’ founder, which he also edited, annotated, and introduced; _Living Space: Poems of the Dutch Fiftiers_ (Green Integer, 2005), an expanded new edition, with Douglas Messerli, of the landmark anthology first published in 1979; the novel _The Angel Max_ (Harcourt Brace, 1998); a translation (with Peter Constantine) of Hans Deichmann’s _Objects: A Chronicle of Subversion in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy_; a translation (with André Lefevere) of the 1907 Flemish classic _The Flaxfield_ (Sun & Moon, 1989), a novel by Stijn Streuvels; and another experiment in translation, _Boethius: The Poems from On the Consolation of Philosophy, Translated Out of the Original Latin into Diverse Historical Englishings Diligently Collaged_ (Sun & Moon, 1994).

He was also the joint editor, with the late James Laughlin, of thirty-one volumes of the avant-garde anthologies series, _New Directions in Prose and Poetry_. His short fiction, poetry, translations, essays, and critical reviews have appeared in such publications as _American Poetry_, _Columbia_, _Contact II_, the _Forward_, _Icarus_ (U.K.), _The McGraw-Hill Book of Poetry_, _Modern Poetry in Translation_, _The Nation_, _New Directions in Prose & Poetry_, _The New Leader_, _North Dakota Quarterly_, _Paideuma_, _Plus 22_ (N.Y./Bucharest), _The Pomegranate Series_, _Publishers Weekly_, _Translation Review_, and _Washington Review_.

He is a graduate of Columbia College, and as an undergraduate he was an editor and writer for the college humor magazine, _The Jester_. He has been an editor at _The New Leader_ magazine and of _The New-York Historical Society Quarterly_. From 1970 to 2005, he was an editor at the literary publishing house New Directions, serving as editor in chief and later as editor at large. He was a member of the Executive Board of PEN American Center from 1982 to 1996 and for ten years chaired that organization’s Translation Committee.
