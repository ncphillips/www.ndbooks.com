A Chilean poet and physicist born in 1914, Parra has taken the precision of scientific language and the plain speech of North American modernism and mixed it with his own sardonic humor to invent what he calls “antipoetry,” a poetry pitched against Latin American high rhetoric. New Directions has published _Poems and Antipoems_ (1967); _Emergency Poems_ (1972); _Antipoems: New and Selected_ (1985); and _Antipoems: How to Look Better & Feel Great_ (2004). Also in English translation is _Sermons_ and _Homilies of the Christ of Elqui_.
