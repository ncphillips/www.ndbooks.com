Norman Thomas was born in 1926 in the Welsh coalmining town of Treforest where, he recalls, "everyday-rain soaked coaldust into everything." But when he was seven the Thomas family moved to "a lovely seaside place in the curve of the coastâ€”hills and green fields, and all you could expect to find at the end of the narrow country roads was a white farmhouse or country church." ---
