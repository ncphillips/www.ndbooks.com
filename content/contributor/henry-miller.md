Henry Miller (1891–1980) was born in New York, and spent his childhood in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. In the late ’20s, Miller came to Paris with his wife June, and became acquainted with Anaïs Nin, who would become his lover and patron. Nin was the first publisher of _Tropic of Cancer_, which was the subject of a landmark obscenity trial when it was published in the U.S. in 1961. Miller’s writing, which was often sexually explicit, blended fiction, memoir, personal philosophy and social commentary. Forbidden by authorities, his books were smuggled into the U.S. and became highly influential on the new generation of Beat writers. His later years were spent writing and painting in Big Sur, on the coast of California.
