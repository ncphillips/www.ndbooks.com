Basil Bunting (1900â€“1985) grew up in Newcastle, England, a northern mining area. He had a Quaker education and was profoundly affected by it. He traveled widely in Iran as a journalist, served in British intelligence during World War II, married twice, and had four children. At the time of his death in 1985 he enjoyed recognition as one of the most important British poets of the 20th century.
