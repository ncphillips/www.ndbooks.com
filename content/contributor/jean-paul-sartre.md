Winner of the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature, Jean-Paul Sartre, philosopher, critic, novelist, and dramatist, holds a position of singular eminence in the world of French letters. Among readers and critics familiar with the whole of Sartre’s work, it is generally recognized that his earliest novel, _La Nausée_ (first published in 1938), is his finest and most significant. It is unquestionably a key novel of the twentieth century and a landmark in Existentialist fiction. Sartre (1905–80) is author _Intimacy_ (1939), _The Flies_ (1943), _No Exit_ (1943), and the monumental treatise _Being and Nothingness_ (1943). New Directions publishes Sartre’s _Baudelaire,_ _The Wall_, and _Nausea_.
