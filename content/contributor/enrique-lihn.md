Enrique Lihn Carrasco was a Chilean poet, playwright, and novelist. Born in 1929 in Santiago, Chile, Lihn aspired to be a painter, but after a failed attempt during university, he abandoned that dream to pursue writing. His work revolved around his contempt for the contemporary dictatorship as Chile was governed by a military junta. Works layered with social, political, and religious commentary are common throughout Lihn’s canon. In his later years, he taught literature at the University of Chile. His final book, _Diario de Muerte_ was written in the six weeks preceding his death from cancer in Santiago in 1988.
