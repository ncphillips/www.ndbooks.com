A landscape architect who once operated a construction business with a community storefront on Manhattanâ€™s Lower East Side, Robert Nichols was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1919. He left home at an early age, and some of his travel experiences are recounted in his first book of poems, _Slow Newsreel of Man Riding Train_ (City Lights, 1962). He died of cancer in 2010.
