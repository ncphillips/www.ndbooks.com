New Directions is happy to present a new series of Poetry Pamphlets, a reincarnated version of the "Poet of the Month" and "Poets of the Year" series James Laughlin published in the 1940s, which brought out such eclectic hits as William Carlos Williams's The Broken Span, Delmore Schwartz's poetic play Shenandoah, John Donne's Some Poems and Devotions, and Yvor Winters's Giant Weapon, among many others. The New Directions Poetry Pamphlets will highlight original work by writers from around the world, as well as forgotten treasures lost in the cracks of literary history.â€‹
