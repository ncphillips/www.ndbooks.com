The New Directions Pearl series offers short masterpieces by great authors at enticing prices: under $10! The Pearl series presents short works from contemporary masters such as César Aira and Javier Marías, and also includes relaunches of several ND Bibelots, which introduced readers to seminal works by classic ND authors such as Borges and Mishima.

Designed by Rodrigo Corral, these slim volumes boast a striking minimalist style: bold geometric shapes against a stark white background.
