In Peter Cole’s remarkable book, _Things on Which I’ve Stumbled_, the forces and sources that have long driven his work come together in singular fashion. Plumbing the past as it soars in the present, the collection rides a variable music that takes it from an archeology of mysterious poetic fragments unearthed in a medieval Egyptian synagogue to lyrics suffused with a "normal mysticism" and poignant political commentary on the blighted hills surrounding modern Jerusalem.
