Now back in print in a limited quantity, B.S. Johnson’s lost classic has been showered with praise: _New York Magazine_ named _The Unfortunates_ one of their Ten Best Books of 2008, listed in _The New York Times 100 Notable Books of 2008_, and _The L.A. Times_ declared it to be “his most daring work.” A legendary 1960s experiment in form, _The Unfortunates_ is B. S. Johnson’s famous “book in a box,” in which the chapters are presented unbound, to be read in any order the reader chooses. A sportswriter, sent to a Midlands town on a weekly assignment, finds himself confronted by ghosts from the past when he disembarks at the train station. Memories of one of his best, most trusted friends, a tragically young victim of cancer, begin to flood through his mind as he attempts to go about the routine business of reporting a soccer match.
