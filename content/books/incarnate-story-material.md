Thalia Fieldâ€™s new book explores the very condition of being incarnate: how, invested with human form, we experience both suffering and ecstasy from childhood to adulthood to death. As with her previous book _Point and Line_ (2000), _Incarnate_ defies categorization: written in a variety of poetic and prose-like forms, it "industriously works the sparsely populated and as yet underdeveloped borderlands between poetry, fiction, theater" (_Review of Contemporary Fiction_). As Carole Maso says in the _American Book Review_, Thalia Field is "playful, subversive, and intense." In _Incarnate: Story Material_, she continues to reach beyond borders, examining how, trapped in our own stories, we act and react in a world we make solid, perceiving something "other" close at hand.
