The arresting beauty of Shusaku Endo’s fiction is best known in the West through his highly acclaimed novels _The Samurai_ and _Silence_. His consummately wrought short stories, with their worlds of deep shadows and achieved clarity, are less familiar. The dozen stories of _Stained Glass Elegies_, selected by the author together with his translator, display the full range of Endo’s talents in short fiction.
