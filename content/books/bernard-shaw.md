Mr. Bentley first treats of Shaw’s politics, indicating their historical context, and then proceeds to his religious opinions and an interpretation of his "natural mysticism." The major part of the book, naturally, is devoted to Shaw’s theatre. Here the chief plays are analyzed in some detail and their themes related to the whole pattern of the Shavian lifework. Mr. Bentley then sums up Shaw’s career, suggesting that he lived out the "tragedy of greatness" which figures in some of his plays.
