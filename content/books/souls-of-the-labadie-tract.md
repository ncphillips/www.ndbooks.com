Three long poems interspersed with prose pieces, _Souls of the Labadie Trac_t takes as its starting point the Labadists, a Utopian Quietest sect that moved from the Netherlands to Cecil County, Maryland, in 1684. The community dissolved in 1722. In _Souls_, Howe is lured by archives and libraries, with their ghosts, cranks, manuscripts, and scraps of material. One thread winding through _Souls_ is silken: from the epigraphs of Edwards ("the silkworm is a remarkable type of Christ...") and of Stevens ("the poet makes silk dresses out of worms") to the mulberry tree (food of the silkworms) and the fragment of a wedding dress that ends the book. _Souls of the Labadie Tract_ presents Howe with her signature hybrids of poetry and prose, of evocation and refraction.
