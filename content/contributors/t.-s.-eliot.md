T. S. Eliot was an American-born poet and winner of the 1948 Nobel Prize for Literature. He was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1888 but moved to Europe in 1910, becoming a British citizen in 1927. While working for Lloyds Bank in London he wrote _The Waste Land_, widely regarded as one of the finest achievements in 20th Century poetry. That same year he founded the highly influential literary magazine _The Criterion_, publishing the work of Virginia Woolf, W.B. Yeats and Marcel Proust. In 1925 he joined the publishing house Faber & Faber, where he would remain until the end of his life. Though he lived until 1965, _Four Quartets_ (1945), which Eliot considered his finest achievement, was the last collection of poetry to be published in his lifetime.Â
