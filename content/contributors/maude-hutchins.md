Maude Phelps Hutchins (1899–1992) was born in New York but brought up on Long Island. "After graduation from Yale University where she received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree she pursued a talent for drawing by studying in an art school and in a number of one-man exhibitions in galleries and museums across the country attaining a considerable reputation as a sculptress. Despite her activities along these lines and her role as the mother of three daughters a deep urge for writing persisted and Mrs. Hutchins began publishing short stories poems and plays-for-reading in various literary magazines. Her first novel _Georgiana_ appeared in 1948 and had immediate critical success. Her second novel _A Diary of Love_ was threatened with banning in Chicago but the municipal authorities retreated when the American Civil Liberties Union and leading literary figures came to the book’s defense. Following these novels a collection of short stories and plays-for-reading (_Love is a Pie_) and a third novel (_My Hero_) were published by New Directions.
