Bankim-Chandra Chatterjee (1838-1894) was born in the village of Katalpara near Naihati. His novels firmly laid the foundation of the Indian novel. Indeed, Chatterjee is the father of the Indian novel - and one of the greatest Indian novelists. The Chatterjees were an orthodox Brahman family; thus early family influences probably had something to do with the conservative attitudes in religious and social matters so noticeable in Bankimâ€™s writings. He was one of the first two graduates of the newly founded Calcutta University. In the same year he was appointed to the Civil Service as a Deputy Magistrate and Collector, an office which he held with great credit until his retirement.
