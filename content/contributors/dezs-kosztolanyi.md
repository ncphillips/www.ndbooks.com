Dezső Kosztolányi was born in 1885 and gained notoriety as a journalist in Budapest during the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. An integral member of the intellectual and literary circles of the period, he published his first collection of poems, _Within Four Walls_, to great acclaim in 1907. His writings have influenced generations of Hungarian writers ever since. He died of throat cancer in 1936.
