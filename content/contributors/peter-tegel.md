Peter Tegel fled Sudetenland, a region of the former Czechoslovakia, at the age of six with his Czech-German family. He escaped to Britain to avoid the Nazis and then graduated from Balliol College, Oxford. He has produced translations of German, French and Russian literature. Currently, Tegel is co-chair of the Pushkin Club, a nonpolitical organization in London that is dedicated to Russian artistic and literary culture.
