Mirra Ginsburg (1909–2000) was born in Bobruysk, Byelorussia, and spent her childhood surrounded by nature. This setting was a relief from her family’s extreme poverty and though her parents were poor they raised her with an appreciation of culture and politics. A prolific writer and translator, Ginsburg settled in the United States. She is best know for introducing the West to Siberian and Central Asian folklore, and for her childrens’ books. She has also translated a number of important works of Russian literature, including novels by Mikhail Bulgakov and Fyodor Dostoyevsky.
