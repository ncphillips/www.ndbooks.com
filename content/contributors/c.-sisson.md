C. H. Sisson (1914â€“2003), one of the great poets of the latter 20th century, was born in Bristol, England. He attended the University of Bristol and after traveling throughout Germany and France entered the British civil service in 1936, where he served until his retirement in 1973. He began publishing poetry in the mid-50s, at first focusing on translations; his first volume of original work, _The London Zoo,_ appeared in 1961, and he continued to publish poetry, translations, and essays well into his eighties.
