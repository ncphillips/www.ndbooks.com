An American born in Boston in 1935, Sobin moved to the south of France as a young man to study independently with René Char and Martin Heidegger, and spent the rest of his life there. New Directions published three books of poetry, _The Earth as Air_ (1984); _Voyaging Portraits_ (1988); and _Breath’s Burials_ (1995); and his translation of Henri Michaux’s _Ideograms in China_ (1984). Other poetry volumes include _By the Bias of Sound: Selected Poems 1974–1994_; _Toward the Blanched Alphabets_; and _The Places as Preludes_. His novels are _Venus Blue_; _Dark Mirrors: A Novel of Provence_; _The Fly-Truffler_; and _In Pursuit of a Vanishing Star_. He is the author of an extraordinary archeological meditation in two volumes, _Luminous Debris: Reflecting on Vestige in Provence and Languedoc,_ and _Ladder of Shadows._ Sobin died in 2005.
