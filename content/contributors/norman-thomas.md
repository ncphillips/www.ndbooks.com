Norman Thomas was born in 1926 in the Welsh coalmining town of Treforest where, he recalls, "everyday-rain soaked coaldust into everything." But when he was seven the Thomas family moved to "a lovely seaside place in the curve of the coast—hills and green fields, and all you could expect to find at the end of the narrow country roads was a white farmhouse or country church." ---
