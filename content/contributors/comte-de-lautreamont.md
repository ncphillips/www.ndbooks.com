Comte de Lautréamont was the pen name of Isidore Lucien Ducasse (1846–1870), born in Montevideo, Uruguay, the son of a French consular officer. Ducasse was sent to France for high school and soon after began writing poetry. He died from a fever in Paris, but his small body of work became a huge influence on the Surrealists years after his death.
