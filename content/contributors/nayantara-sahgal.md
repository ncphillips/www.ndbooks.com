Nayantara Sahgal (1927– ) is a novelist and political journalist. As a member of the Gandhi family she says that, "Behind Nehru’s niece or Madame Pandit’s daughter has neither been a help nor a hindrance—it has simply been my inheritance and background—but being Mrs. Gandhi’s cousin as well as critic is another matter. It has given me a glimpse of how intolerant establishments reduce their critics to non-persons."
