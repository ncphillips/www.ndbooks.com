His previous volumes—_Rift_ and _Hymns & Qualms—_were collected as _What Is Doubled: Poems, 1981–1998_. In addition to his ND books with Aharon Shabtai and Yoel Hoffmann, Cole’s translations from Hebrew and Arabic include _The Dream of the Poem: Hebrew Poetry from Muslim and Christian Spain, 950–1492_, Taha Muhammad Ali’s _So What: New & Selected Poems 1973–2005_, Avraham Ben Yitzhak’s _Collected Poems_, and _The Poetry of Kabbalah: Mystical Verse from the Jewish Tradition_ (forthcoming). With Adina Hoffman, he is the author of a volume of non-fiction, _Sacred Trash: The Lost and Found World of the Cairo Geniza_. Cole has received numerous honors for his work, including fellowships from the NEA, the NEH, and the Guggenheim Foundation, as well as the National Jewish Book Award for Poetry and the PEN Translation Award for Poetry. He is the recipient of a 2010 Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and in 2007 was named a MacArthur Fellow.
