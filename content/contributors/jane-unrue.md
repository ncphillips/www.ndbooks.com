Jane Unrue was born in Columbus, Ohio, grew up in Las Vegas, Nevada, and graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (B.A.) and Brown University (M.F.A.). Hailed by Publishers Weekly as a writer of "muted intensity and subtly disarming power," Unrue is the author of the short novels _Life of a Star_ (2010) and _The House_ (2000), both published by Burning Deck Press; the short fiction collection _Atlassed_ (2005), published by Triple Press; and the short novel _Dear Mr. Erker_, published in the final issue (No. 11) of _3rd Bed_. She lives in Boston and has taught expository writing in the Harvard College Writing Program for the past eight years. At Harvard she directs the Scholars at Risk Program, which provides fellowships for at-risk and persecuted scholars and writers so that they may live and work in safety, and is a member of the Scholars at Risk Committee and the University Committee on Human Rights Studies. She is also a member of the executive board of New England PEN.
