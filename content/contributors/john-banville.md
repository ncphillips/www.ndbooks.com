John Banville was born in Wexford, Ireland in 1945. He is the author of more than fifteen novels, a short story collection, and several mysteries written under the pseudonym Benjamin Black. His most recent novel, _Ancient Light_, won the Irish Book Award, and he received the Man Booker Prize in 2005 for his novel _The Sea_. Often compared to James, Proust, and Nabokov, Banville is a master stylist known for his precision, witâ€”and occasional controversy.
