Born in Dublin, James Joyce (1882–1941) was a modernist and proponent of the stream-of-consciousness writing style and is widely considered one of the most important writers of the twentieth century. His works feature primarily Dublin figures such as in the short story collection _Dubliners_ (1914), and the novels _A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man_ (1916), _Ulysses_ (1922) and _Finnegan’s Wake_ (1939).
