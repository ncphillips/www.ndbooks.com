Kim Stanley Robinson, born in 1952, is recognized for his literary science fiction work particularly his award-winning _Mars_ triology. _Rexroth in the Sierra_ is edited with an introduction and notes by Robinson, who like Rexroth, exemplifies a true love for California, consistently recognizing and embodying themes of ecology and sociology in his work.
