Join beloved poet Anne Carson at 92Y as she reads from _FLOAT_, her forthcoming collection of performance pieces and other poetic writing.

“Reading her books is both an exhilarating and a bewildering experience,” writes Charles Simic. “Carson takes risks, subverts literary conventions and plays havoc with our expectations. She is a wonder: an unconventional, often difficult poet with a huge following.”
