**Rachel Kushner** is the author of two novels, _Telex from Cuba_ (2008) and _The Flamethrowers_ (2013), as well as a collection of short stories, _The Strange Case of Rachel K_ (2015). She was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2013.

“I’m thrilled that Rachel Kushner is coming to Purchase as part of our incredible Durst Distinguished Lecture Series this year. It’s exciting for our students to be able to interact with her and her work,” says Kathleen McCormick, Purchase College professor of literature and pedagogy.

According to Monica Ferrell, associate professor of creative writing at Purchase College, “Rachel Kushner is a virtuosic writer. Like Reno, the visual artist-turned-racecar driver who serves as one of her protagonists, she is something of a daredevil, operating at high speeds and with a high degree of risk. Kushner conjures up worlds as distinctive and dissimilar as that of American expatriates in 1950s Havana, the grittily glamorous art scene of 1970s New York, and the Italian battlefields of World War I, among others. While it probes historical junctures of political and public significance, her work is nevertheless intimate and personal: at the core of each of these stories are human relationships and the rich depths of sensitively-registered emotional shifts.”

The Durst Distinguished Lecture Series and the Roy and Shirley Durst Distinguished Chair in Literature are funded by the Roy and Shirley Durst Distinguished Chair in Literature Endowment. The mission of the Durst programs is to infuse the experience and intellect of leading writers into the Purchase community, while providing diverse opportunities for these writers to interact with students and influence campus life.
