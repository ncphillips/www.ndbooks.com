The monumental _Complete Stories of Clarice Lispector_ in Katrina Dodsonâ€™s much-lauded translation exploded on the U.S. literary scene in 2015. Dodson will speak about the Lispector phenomenon and the joys and challenges of translating her work in conversation with Susan Bernofsky, Director of Literary Translation at Columbia, and Minna Proctor.
