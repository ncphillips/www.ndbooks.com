For the centennial of his birth, the Rare Book and Manuscript Library is delighted to present an exhibit on the life and legacy of Thomas Merton, drawn from RBML's very extensive Thomas Merton holdings, from the papers of his teacher and friend, Mark Van Doren, and from those of his friend and official biographer, John Howard Griffin.
