New Directions invites you to a celebration of Bohumil Hrabal’s _MR. KAFKA AND OTHER TALES FROM THE TIME OF THE CULT_

Please join us on Thursday November 5th, at 7:00 pm for a conversation between translator Paul Wilson and Columbia University lecturer in Czech language Christopher Harwood, at the Czech Center of New York. Pilsner will be served.

“Hrabal’s magical stories are comic and human—they are really desires embodied. They inhabit a utopian province, the realm of laughter and tears.” —James Wood, London Review of Books

**Bohumil Hrabal** (1914–1997) was born in Moravia and started writing poems under the influence of French surrealism. He wrote such classics as Closely Watched Trains (made into an Academy Award-winning film directed by Jiri Menzel), The Death of Mr. Baltisberger, and Too Loud a Solitude. He fell to his death from the fifth floor of a Prague hospital, apparently trying to feed the pigeons.

**Paul Wilson** is a writer and translator who lived in the Czech Republic from 1967 to 1977. He has translated books by Václav Havel, Bohumil Hrabal, Ivan Klima and Josef Škvorecký. He lives in Canada.

**Christopher Harwood**, PhD., SVU-NY (moderator) is a lecturer at Columbia University’s Slavic Department. He is currently teaching a course on Czech literature and film in the 1960s.
