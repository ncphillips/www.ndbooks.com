Panelists discuss the book's unique format and its political and historical commentary.

Panelists include:

*   **John Keene**, Associate Professor, Departments of English and African American Studies, Rutgers-Newark
*   **Phillip Brian Harper**, Erich Maria Remarque Professor of Literature and Professor of Social & Cultural Analysis, New York University
*   **Sonya Posmentier**, Assistant Professor of English, New York University
