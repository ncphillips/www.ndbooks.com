Thomas Merton (1915 – 1968) was a Catholic writer, theologian and mystic. A Trappist monk of the Abbey of Gethsemani, Kentucky, he was a poet, social activist, and student of comparative religion. He wrote more than 70 books, mostly on spirituality, social justice and pacifism, as well as scores of essays and reviews. His bestselling autobiography, "The Seven Storey Mountain (1948)," was selected by National Review as one of the 100 best non-fiction books of the 20th century.

Robert Lax (1915 — 2000) taught English at the University of North Carolina, then set off to find a simpler life. He wrote for The New Yorker, was poetry editor at Time magazine, had a stint as a Hollywood scriptwriter, and even traveled with a circus as a juggler. He would eventually land on the Greek island of Patmos, living out the rest of his life writing poetry as he sought a life of simplicity, humility and grace.
