The University of Denver is pleased to announce that Bernadette Mayer, a finalist for the National Books Critics Circle Award, will visit on February 2nd and 3rd, 2017. Bernadette Mayer is an American poet, writer, and visual artist associated with both the Language poets and the New York School. Mayer's record-keeping and use of stream-of-consciousness narrative are two trademarks of her writing, though she is also known for her work with form and mythology. Mayer’s poetry is widely acknowledged as some of the first to speak accurately and honestly about the experience of motherhood.

“What a clear, insistent health there is here,” Robert Creeley wrote of Mayer’s poems. “As if the so-called world were seriously the point, which it is, and we could actually live in it, which we do.”

These two events are free and open to the general public:

Thursday, February 2, 6 pm, Sturm Hall 451—A talk
Friday, February 3, 7 pm, Linday Auditorium, Sturm Hall 281—A reading

Sturm Hall is at the corner of Asbury and Race Streets. There is a paid parking lot across Race Street from the building.
