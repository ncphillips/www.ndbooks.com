Nathaniel Mackey is an award-winning poet, novelist, editor and critic. He is the author of numerous books of poetry, including _Nod House_ (2011), the National Book Award-winning _Splay Anthem_ (2006) and _Eroding Witness_ (1985), which was chosen for the National Poetry Series. He has published several book-length installments of his ongoing prose work, _From a Broken Bottle Traces of Perfume Still Emanate_, beginning with _Bedouin Hornbook_ in 1986. A _New York Times_ review described the prose project as “not simply writing about jazz, but writing as jazz.” Mackey is the long-time editor of the avant-garde literary journal _Hambone_ and currently teaches creative writing at Duke University. The reading will be followed by refreshments.
