In the Assembly Room of the Belmont Public Library, librarian Miriam MacNair will discuss the life and work of poet Denise Levertov, focusing on _The Collected Poems of Denise Levertov_ and on two biographies, _Denise Levertov: A Poet's Life_ by Dana Greene and _A Poet's Revolution: The Life of Denise Levertov_ by Donna Krolik Hollenberg.
Born in England in 1923, Levertov emigrated in 1948 to the United States. She published her first book of poetry in England at the age of 23, but it was not until she moved to the United States that she found her poetic voice, helped by poets William Carlos Williams, Robert Duncan and Robert Creeley. Levertov was acclaimed by Kenneth Rexroth in _The New York Times_ as "the most subtly skillful poet of her generation."
All are welcome to attend this free program, sponsored by the Friends of the Belmont Public Library. Refreshments will be provided. The Assembly Room is handicapped accessible.
