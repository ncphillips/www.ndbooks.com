The remarkable showcase, _Tennessee Williams: The Playwright and the Painter_, is a major coup for St. Louis. These 18 deeply personal paintings, only once before shown outside of Key West, illustrate how Williams' magical poetry brilliantly suffuses every art form he undertakes. Exhibited at the St. Louis University Museum of Art, they are on loan from the Key West Art & Historical Society and the owner of the paintings, Williamsâ€™s longtime friend David Wolkowsky.
