Small Press Traffic hosts poet Bernadette Mayer for a public reading and conversation.

Since 1974 Small Press Traffic (SPT) has been at the heart of the San Francisco Bay Area innovative writing scene, bringing together authors, readers, educators, small presses, and community members through talks, readings, workshops, and performances.

Bernadette Mayer was born in Brooklyn, New York, and has spent most of her life in New York City. Her collections of poetry include _Midwinter Day_ (1982, 1999), _A Bernadette Mayer Reader_ (1992), _The Desire of Mothers to Please Others in Letters_ (1994), _Another Smashed Pinecone_ (1998), _Poetry State Forest_ (2008), and the forthcoming _Works and Days_ (2016).
