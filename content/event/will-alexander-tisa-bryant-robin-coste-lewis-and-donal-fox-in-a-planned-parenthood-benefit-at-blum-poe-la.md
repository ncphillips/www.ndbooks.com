**Will Alexander** published his first poetry collection, _Vertical Rainbow Climber_ in 1987. He went on to publish numerous books of poetry, including _Asia & Haiti_ (2000), _The Sri Lankan Loxodrome_ (2009), and _Kaleidoscopic Omniscience_ (2013). In 2016, Alexander received the Jackson Poetry Prize awarded by Poets & Writers; the judges' citation notes: "It is tempting to label Alexander a surrealist or experimentalist, but he is truly a singular voice. Ultimately, his poetry is rooted in a belief in the transformative powers of language." Also known for his essays and nonfiction, he is the author of _Singing in Magnetic Hoofbeat: Essays, Prose Texts, Interviews, and a Lecture 1991-2007_ (2013), which was awarded the American Book Award. Alexander is the recipient of a California Arts Council Fellowship, a PEN/Oakland Josephine Miles Award, and a Whiting Fellowship, among many others. He has taught at several universities, including the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics and the University of California, San Diego.

**Tisa Bryant's** writing thrives where genre, form and subjectivity intersect. She is the author of _Unexplained Presence_ (2007), a collection of fiction essays on Black presences in film, literature and visual arts; co-editor of _The Encyclopedia Project_, a cross-referenced literary journal; and a commissioned writer/researcher for Clockshop's _Radio Imagination_, the year-long Los Angeles celebration of science-fiction writer Octavia Butler. She is working on _The Curator_, a book of imagined cinema and lived experience, and _Residual_, an exploration of grief, longing, desire and archival research. She teaches writing at the California Institute of the Arts, and lives in Los Angeles.

**Robin Coste Lewis**' first poetry collection, _Voyage of the Sable Venus_, won the National Book Award for poetry in 2015. She has been a finalist for the International War Poetry Prize, the National Rita Dove Prize, and a semifinalist for the "Discovery"/Boston Review Prize and the Crab Orchard Series Open Poetry Prize. Her work has appeared in _The Massachusetts Review_, _Callaloo_, _The Harvard Gay & Lesbian Review_, _Transition_, and _VIDA_,among others. She has taught at Wheaton College, Chicago, Illinois; Hunter College, New York, New York; Hampshire College, Amherst, Massachusetts; and the NYU Low-Residency MFA in Paris and has received numerous residency fellowships and awards. Currently a Provost's Fellow at the University of Southern California, Lewis now lives in Los Angeles; her family is originally from New Orleans.

**Donal Fox** is internationally acclaimed as composer, pianist, and improviser in both jazz and classical music. His numerous awards include a Guggenheim fellowship in music composition, and a fellowship from the Bogliasco Foundation. He served as the first African American Composer-in-Residence with the St. Louis Symphony and was a visiting artist at Harvard University, where he received a Certificate of Recognition for his contribution to the arts. He has been Composer-in-Residence at Oberpfälzer Künstlerhaus, Germany; Tyrone Guthrie Centre, Ireland; Djerassi Resident Artists Program, CA; Liguria Study Center, Italy; and the Tanglewood Contemporary Music Festival, MA, among others. He is a recipient of the prestigious American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in music, and a Martin Luther King Jr. Visiting Scholar Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
