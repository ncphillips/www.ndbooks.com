Literary Death Match is teaming with the masterminds at ALTA for an all-out night of brilliant lit that will pit translators versus the translated, plus comedic styling and enough tomfoolery to bring you to your feet.

Literary Death Match features four writers who read their own work for seven minutes or less, who are then judged by three all-star judges. They select two finalists to compete in the Literary Death Match finale, a vaguely literary game to decide the ultimate winner.

**Judges:**

Literary Merit: Andrew Lam

Performance: Dhaya Lakshminarayanan

IntangiblesL Lydia Popovich

**Readers:**

Bae Suah

Deborah Smith

Edward Gauvin

Becka McKay

**Host:**

Adrian Todd Zuniga
