Translator **Katrina Dodson** will be reading selections from _The Complete Stories_ by **Clarice Lispector** as part of Us&Them: A Writer/Translator reading series at the 39th annual ALTA Conference on Saturday, October 8th, 2016. She will also be reading an essay written for the _Believer_ based on the journal chronicling her experiences while translating Lispector's work.

**Katrina Dodson's** work has appeared in _Granta_, _McSweeney's_, and _Two Lines_. She holds a PhD in comparative literature at the University of California, Berkeley.

**Clarice Lispector** was born in 1920 to a Jewish family in western Ukraine. As a result of the anti-Semitic violence they endured, the family fled to Brazil in 1922, and Clarice Lispector grew up in Recife. Following the death of her mother when Clarice was nine, she moved to Rio de Janeiro with her father and two sisters, and she went on to study law. With her husband, who worked for the foreign service, she lived in Italy, Switzerland, England, and the United States, until they separated and she returned to Rio in 1959; she died there in 1977. Since her death, Clarice Lispector has earned universal recognition as Brazil's greatest modern writer.
