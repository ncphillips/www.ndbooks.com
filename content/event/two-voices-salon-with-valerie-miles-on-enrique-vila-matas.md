Join Two Lines on Thursday, February 11 for the first salon of 2016, featuring powerhouse editor and translator Valerie Miles, who will be in conversation with Two Lines Press’s Scott Esposito via Skype.

Miles will be discussing her newly translated novella _Because She Never Asked_ by the Spanish writer Enrique Vila-Matas. Called “Spain’s most significant contemporary literary figure” by _The New Yorker_, Vila-Matas excels in creating witty fictions out of his real life that deconstruct the act of writing and make us reconsider many of the key figures of literature and cinema of the 20th century.

In _Because She Never Asked_, Vila-Matas plays with both his own life and the life of the famous artist Sophie Calle. As Vila-Matas writes, “Something strange happened along the way. Normally, writers try to pass a work of fiction off as being real. But in _Because She Never Asked_, the opposite occurred: in order to give meaning to the story of my life, I found that I needed to present it as fiction.”

We’ll also talk with Valerie about her distinguished career as an editor, working with a who’s-who of the greatest writing in the Spanish language of the last 30 years.
