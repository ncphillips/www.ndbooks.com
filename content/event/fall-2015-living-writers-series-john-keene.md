On October 22nd John Keene, author of _Counternarratives_ will take part in the _Living Writers Series_ at UC Santa Cruz.

Each quarter, the Humanities Division’s _Living Writers Series_ brings visiting authors and poets into UC Santa Cruz classes to give students an in-depth look into the world of the working writer.

This fall, the series will focus on the theme of _Creative Work & Critical Play_. _Creative Work & Critical Play_ features contemporary writers and artists who mine issues of race, sexuality, gender, and class through several genres and media--including poetry, fiction, critical prose, performance, sonic and visual art, and memoir.

The event will begin at 4:00 pm.

Admission is free, and the public is invited. For more information, email rvwilson@ucsc.edu.
