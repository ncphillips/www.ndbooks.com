Join Lydia Davis and Rachel Careau as they discuss the life and work of author Roger Lewinter.

This event is in English, free and open to the public, with no RSVP necessary.

**Roger Lewinter** was born in Montauban, France, in 1941, to Austrian Jewish parents. The family moved to Switzerland during the war, and he has lived much of his life in Geneva. For more than forty years he has worked as a writer (of both literary and scholarly works), an editor, and a translator (of Georg Groddeck, Karl Kraus, Elias Canetti, Robert Walser, and Rilke, among others). Among his dozen books are three works of fiction.

**Rachel Careau** is a writer and translator and the author of one book of prose poems, Itineraries. Her work has appeared recently in _Plume_ and _Two Lines._ She began translating the writing of the Swiss author Roger Lewinter while in graduate school in 1989 and spent time working closely with him in Geneva in 2012. In addition to continuing to translate Lewinter’s texts, she is working on a collection of her own short prose. She holds a BA from Barnard College and an MFA in writing from Bard College and lives with her husband in Hudson, New York.

**Lydia Davis**, a MacArthur Fellow, is the author of _The Collected Stories of Lydia Davis_ and the translator of Gustave Flaubert’s _Madame Bovary_.

**Saul Anton** is a writer, scholar, and critic. He teaches currently at the Pratt Institute, New York. He is the author of the critical fiction _Warhol’s Dream_ and has written for _Afterall, Artforum, Cabinet, Frieze,_ and other publications.
