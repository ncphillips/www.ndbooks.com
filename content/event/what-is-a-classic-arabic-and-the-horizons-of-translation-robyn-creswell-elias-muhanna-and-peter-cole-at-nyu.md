A panel discussion with **Robyn Creswell** (Comparative Literature, Yale), **Elias Muhanna** (Comparative Literature, Brown), and **Peter Cole** (Poet and Translator)

The rich corpus of Classical Arabic literature, encompassing poetry, history, science, and theology, is only beginning to be translated into English. What special obstacles do these texts pose for translators, and how might they speak to contemporary concerns with comparative philology, secular traditions within Islam, and the specter of untranslatability? Shihab al-Din al-Nuwayri’s 14th-century encyclopedia, _The Ultimate Ambition in the Arts of Erudition_, is a compendium of historical knowledge, literary craft, and scientific lore. Abdelfattah Kilito’s _The Tongue of Adam_ is an analysis of medieval Arabic speculations on the origins of multilingualism and of poetic speech. Elias Muhanna and Robyn Creswell will discuss their translations of these works and reflect on what classical Arabic literature can offer to contemporary readers and scholars. Poet and translator Peter Cole will moderate their discussion.

**Robyn Creswell** is an Assistant Professor of Comparative Literature at Yale and poetry editor of The Paris Review. He is the translator of Abdelfattah Kilito’s _The Tongue of Adam_ and _The Clash of Images_, as well as Sonallah Ibrahim’s _That Smell_, all published by New Directions.

**Elias Muhanna** is the Manning Assistant Professor of Comparative Literature at Brown University. His books include the abridged translation of Shihab al-Din al-Nuwayri's encyclopedia, _The Ultimate Ambition in the Arts of Erudition_ (Penguin), and _The Digital Humanities and Islamic & Middle East Studies_ (De Gruyter).

**Peter Cole** is Horace W. Goldsmith Senior Lecturer of Judaic Studies and Comparative Literature at Yale University. He is also the author of four books of poems, most recently _The Invention of Influence_ (New Directions). His many volumes of translation include _The Poetry of Kabbalah_ (Yale University Press) and _The Dream of the Poem: Hebrew Poetry from Muslim and Christian Spain, 950–1492_ (Princeton University Press). In the spring of 2017, Farrar, Straus, and Giroux will publish _Hymns & Qualms: New and Selected Poems and Translations_.
