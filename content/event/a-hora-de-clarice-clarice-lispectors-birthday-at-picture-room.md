We're throwing a birthday party for Clarice Lispector! Join us on Saturday, December 10th at 6pm at [Picture Room](https://www.facebook.com/pictureroomnyc/).

A Hora de Clarice, an annual celebration in honor of the Brazilian writer Clarice Lispector's birthday, has been running in Brazil for the last five years with simultaneous celebrations in Paris, Madrid, Lisbon, Frankfurt, Buenos Aires, and Mexico City. Please join us on December 10th, 2016, as we toast the great Clarice and celebrate the recent translations of her work published by New Directions. Joining us are writers Dia Felix and Stephanie LaCava, who will both be reading short pieces by Lispector.

Stephanie LaCava is a writer living in New York and founder of Small Press books for children. Her work has appeared online and in magazines such as the Los Angeles Review of Books, Interview, Texte zur Kunst and The Believer. In 2013, LaCava was a judge alongside Lidia Yuknavitch and Maggie Nelson for the Creative Nonfiction category of the PEN American Centerâ€™s Literary Awards.

Writer and filmmaker Dia Felix is author of the Lambda-nominated experimental novel Nochita, published on City Lights/Sister Spit in 2014. She curates a pan-genre literary performance series, GUTS, at Dixon Place and has a book of doomed loved poems coming out in 2017 from Projective Industries. She's from California and lives in East Harlem, New York.
