Please join Triple Canopy for a day-long series of conversations on the state of literary genre and contemporary prose. Writers Hilton Als, Andrew Durbin, Rivka Galchen, Tan Lin, Sukhdev Sandhu, Christine Smallwood, Jonathan Sturgeon, and Lynne Tillman will participate in a trio of discussions on criticism, style, and autofiction, convened by Triple Canopy editors Lucy Ives and Sarah Resnick.

**1:00—2:00 p.m., On Criticism**
Where and how does criticism find its place? If criticism has traditionally circulated via the magazine and within the academy, what new occasions and pursuant forms present themselves today? Sukhdev Sandhu, Christine Smallwood, and Lynne Tillman in conversation.

**2:30—3:30 p.m., On Style**
Can one make an argument—or a fiction—by style alone? Hilton Als and Rivka Galchen in conversation.

**4:00—5:00 p.m., On Autofiction
**The narrator may or may not be the writer, and the writer may or may not be the author, and the author may or may not be “I.” On autofiction’s ambiguous vérité. Andrew Durbin, Tan Lin, and Jonathon Sturgeon in conversation
