Translated by Susan Bernofsky, Lydia Davis, and Christopher Middleton, _Looking at Pictures_ presents a little-known facet of the work of the eccentric genius Robert Walser (1878-1956): his writing on art.

Please join the New Museum, Christine Burgin, and New Directions for a celebration of Robert Walser with readings from Susan Bernofsky, Moyra Davey, Josiah McElheny, Nathaniel Weaver, Barbara Epler, and Christine Burgin.

The book launch will be held in the New Museum's Sky Room. Please note: on Thursday evenings entry to the New Museum is pay-what-you-wish. Admission to the museum is need to attend the celebration.

_This painting portrays something like a moral dilapidation.
__But are not loosenings of moral strictures at times elegant?
__This category includes women who are, to begin with, beautiful, and secondarily straying, etc., from the proper path.
__A variety of straying would seem to be the subject of the picture I am observing here, which appears to have been painted with exceptional delicacy, caution, precision, intelligence and melodiousness._
â€”from "A Discussion of a Picture."
