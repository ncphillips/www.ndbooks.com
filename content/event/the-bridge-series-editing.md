**Presented in partnership with [The Bridge](http://thebridgeseries.org/) and the [PEN America Translation Committee](http://www.pen.org/translation)**

How do you edit a translation? Four experienced editors discuss the pleasures and puzzles of working on translations, from dealing with cultural differences to handling “translationese.” Moderator Sal Robinson will be joined by Lexy Bloom, Jeremy Davies, and Declan Spring.
