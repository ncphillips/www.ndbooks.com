Iraqi Poet Dunya Mikhail and translator Kareem Abu-Zeid will hold a public conversation on the translation of Mikhailâ€™s most recent collection of poetry, The Iraqi Nights. They will discuss the creative collaboration between poet and translator, and the challenges of translating between two languages as different as Arabic and English. They will talk about how to consider nuance, cultural context, politics and beauty in the process of translation.
