At the height of WWI, poet W. B . Yeats collaborated with members of the avant garde to stage his Japanese noh inspired dance play _At the Hawk's Well_ (1916). To mark its centennial, Turner Prize winner Simon Starling reinterprets this production in an exhibition that illustrates the impact of noh on Western Modernism. Newly created masks, costumes, and a dance on video are paired with works by the 20th-century masters connected to Yeats' play, bringing to life Starling's irrepressible inventiveness.

**Admission**:
$12; students & seniors $10; Japan Society members & children under 16 free.
