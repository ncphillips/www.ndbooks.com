Fifty years on, Alexander Kluge is best known as a leading figure of the New German Cinema, born of the 1962 Oberhausen Manifesto. Yet his seminal filmmaking of the 1960s and 1970s is paralleled by his subsequent work as a writer, theorist, and film and television director. Publications pairing Kluge’s writing with the photography of Gerhard Richter, a collaboration with artist duo DAS INSTITUT (Kerstin Brätsch and Adele Röder), and boundary-pushing television productions all testify to the genre-defying vision of a true pioneer. This evening's program, produced by Kluge especially for _Modern Mondays_, consists of three parts: the first centering on events like “Bataclan” (Paris attacks, November 13, 2015), the second on labor and security (Tchernobyl, with Nobel Prize winner Svetlana Alexievich), and the third on the strange answers that operas give to our time (with a contribution from Richard Sennett: “Why don’t dictators learn from operas?”). Each section is followed by a conversation with the artist. This program joins other celebrations of Kluge’s work at Anthology Film Archives (October 21–22) and Goethe-Institut (October 23). Presented in conjunction with the Goethe-Institut.
