A Hora de Clarice, an annual celebration in honor of the Brazilian writer Clarice Lispector's birthday, has been running in Brazil for the last five years with simultaneous celebrations in Paris, Madrid, Lisbon, Frankfurt, Buenos Aires, and Mexico City. Please toast to Clarice with fellow readers and lovers of the great woman and her work on December 10, 2016, at the Instituto Moreira Sallas.

At **4:30 PM**, please come and listen to Lispector translators Katrina Dodson and Paloma Vidal in conversation. Join us at **6:30 PM** for a reading of the letters Clarice Lispector and her sisters Tania and Elisa exchanged, with dramatic readings by Georgiana Góes, Gisele Fróes and Raquel Iantas, directed by Bruno Lara Resende.

Katrina Dodson's work has appeared in _Granta_, _McSweeney's_, and _Two Lines_. She holds a PhD in comparative literature at the University of California, Berkeley.
