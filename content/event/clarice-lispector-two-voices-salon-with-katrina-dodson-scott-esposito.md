For Two Voices Salon's first salon of the 2015-16 season Katrina Dodson discusses her translation of _The Complete Stories of Clarice Lispector._

Beginning with Lispector’s adolescence and ending just before her death, these 85 stories show a singular literary intelligence developing throughout an entire lifetime.

**Please note: we will be holding this at the Book Club of California (not the Two Lines Press offices, as we usually do).** Don’t worry, it’s just a couple of blocks from the Two Lines Press offices.

Katrina will be here live and in person, so be sure to bring your copies of Lispector with you, and be ready to participate in the conversation!

Katrina has spent years perfecting their English-language translation, and she will discuss with us all the ins and outs of working with Lispector’s famously bizarre Portuguese. We’ll also talk about how Lispector’s art evolved through the years and just why her mysterious, profound writing has touched so many readers.

Make sure to join us on Thursday, September 24th for the very first Salon of our new season of events! As always, refreshments and snacks will be served, and don’t worry if you have to join us late.

*   Thursday, September 24
*   6:00 pm
*   The Book Club of California
*   312 Sutter St #500, San Francisco, CA 94108
*   Alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, plus snacks
