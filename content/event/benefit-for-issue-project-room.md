**SOLD OUT**

A special evening to benefit ISSUE Project Room at their historic 22 Boerum Place theater. Following the completion of our renovation's initial phase, this event offers a unique opportunity to glimpse ISSUE's home before the final stage of construction begins.

Esteemed performance artist and video pioneer Joan Jonas performs excerpts from a recent work. Composer and vocalist GABI is joined by Michael Pisaro to present his composition _Tombstones_ with a live ensemble of acoustic instruments and percussion. In recognition of the work of Susan Howe, poets Charles Bernstein, MÃ³nica de la Torre, andElizabeth Willis present short readings, and the evening concludes with David Grubbs performing an instrumental excerpt from _Souls of the Labadie Tract_, his collaboration with Howe.

*due to unforeseen circumstances, Susan Howe will not appear.
