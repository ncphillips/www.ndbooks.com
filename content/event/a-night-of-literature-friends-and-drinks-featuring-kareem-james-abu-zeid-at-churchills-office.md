Two Lines hosts an intimate, glamorous evening of literature at the private, wood-lined The Office, recently named one of 7x7s Best Private Dining Rooms in San Francisco.

The night will include music, mingling, snacks, live readings from Issues 23 and 24 of _Two Lines_, and a few other surprises. Translator Kareem James Abu-Zeid will be among those reading.
