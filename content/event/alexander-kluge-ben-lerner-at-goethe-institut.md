One of the undisputed intellectual giants of postwar Germany**, Alexander Kluge** is a writer, theorist, filmmaker, and television pioneer with a prolific career spanning almost six decades. His reputation in the US, however, is still narrowly associated with the 1962 Oberhausen Manifesto calling for a “new German film,” as well as with his acclaimed films of the 1970s. This fall, the Goethe-Institut, Anthology Film Archives, and the Museum of Modern Art honor Kluge’s interdisciplinary oeuvre in its varied expressions, introducing selected works for the first time to local audiences as well as revisiting with him some of the beloved older ones.

At the Goethe-Institut, Kluge and New York-based author **Ben Lerner** meet for a Sunday-evening soiree with literature, films, and music on October 23. Join us as they read and discuss excerpts from Kluge’s latest book _The Great Hour of Kong_ (_Kongs große Stunde_, Suhrkamp, 2015)as well as a selection of new writings prompted by Lerner’s poetry. A short film program created by Kluge for this occasion and live piano music of his choice, including Jacques Offenbach’s_Bataclan_ and Giuseppe Verdi’s _Attila_, promise an unforgettable meander through the creativity and inspiration of an incomparable artist.

Seating is limited at this event. Please [RSVP here](mailto:program@newyork.goethe.org?subject=RSVP%20Alexander%20Kluge%20and%20Ben%20Lerner%20Meet) if you would like to attend.

This program is presented in conjunction with The Museum of Modern Art and Anthology Film Archives, in collaboration with dctp.
