City Lights Books celebrates the release of _Pure Act: The Uncommon Life of Robert La_x. Michael McGregor, author of this new outstanding biography, will be joined by John Beer (former literary assistant and editor of Lax) and S.T. Georgiou (author of _In the Beginning Was Love: Contemplative Words of Robert Lax_) for an evening of readings and discussion.

"_Pure Act_ is much more than a biography. It's a real and full and personal meditation on life, and on what a life is for."--Karen Fisher, author of _A Sudden Country_
