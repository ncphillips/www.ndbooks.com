Gary Snyder & Tom Killion present an evening of film, conversation, and poetry focused on the role arts play in the environmental movement.

As a festival by activists and for activists, _Wild & Scenic_ is organized and produced by [SYRCL (the South Yuba River Citizens League)](http://www.yubariver.org/). Since 1983, they’ve been building a community to protect and restore the rivers of their home watershed, from source to sea. _The Wild & Scenic Film Festival_ puts local and global work into the broader environmental and social context, and serves to remind the audience that everyone is a participant in the global movement for a more wild and scenic world.


Tom Killion is an artist, author, and educator. Perhaps best known for his woodcut prints of the California landscape, his images depict vibrant and artistic treescapes, coastal, and mountain views. Killion has collaborated with Gary Snyder on three large format books: _The High Sierra of California, Tamalpais Walking,_ and _California’s Wild Edge: The Coast in Poetry, History and Prints_


A stunning limited collector’s edition, a letterpressed broadside features Gary Snyder’s poem _For All_ and Tom Killion’s print, _Kaweah Lake_ . Signed by both, the edition is limited to 250. Available for purchase online at [wildandscenicfilmfestival.org](https://www.wildandscenicfilmfestival.org/) or Fest HQ for $150. All proceeds benefit SYRCL.

VIP reception: 4:30pm, 151 Union Square, Grass Valley.


Also join Tom Killion and Gary Snyder, for a reception and booksigning, 11am - 1pm at The Alexander Gallery, 225 Broad Street, Nevada City.
