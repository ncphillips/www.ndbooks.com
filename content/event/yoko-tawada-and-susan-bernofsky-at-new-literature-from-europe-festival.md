Yoko Tawada moved to Hamburg when she was twenty-two from her native Japan. In 2006, she moved to Berlin where she now lives. She writes in both Japanese and German, and has published several books—stories, novels, poems, plays, essays—in both languages.

_The New Yorker_ said Tawada’s work compares to Bruno Schulz, Silvina Ocampo or Franz Kafka and, “is characterized by concordances one doesn’t know what to make of and perceptions that may or may not need to be discounted.”

Please join us to celebrate the publication of her latest book _Memoirs of a Polar Bear_ for a special conversation with Susan Bernofsky, the acclaimed translator of this new work.

FREE AND OPEN TO THE PUBLIC

Co-presented with The New Literature from Europe Festival.

Now in its 13th consecutive year, The New Literature from Europe Festival is an annual celebration of writing from across the European continent. Featuring readings and discussions between leading and emerging literary voices from Europe, and some of America’s foremost writers and critics, the Festival celebrates important new European literature in translation. Founded in 2003, the NLE Festival has quickly become one of New York City's top literature in translation events, attracting award-winning, best-selling and new authors from many diverse European countries each year. The NLE Festival is jointly organized by the European Union National Institutes for Culture (EUNIC) and New York-based European cultural institutes. Most Festival events are free and open to the public.
