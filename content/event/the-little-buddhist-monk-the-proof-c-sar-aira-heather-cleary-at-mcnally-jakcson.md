Two completely different novellas by the inimitable César Aira. _The Little Buddhist Monk_ is a story of Asian invention gone wild, as a diminutive Korean Buddhist monk acts as a tour guide to an increasingly distraught French couple on a working vacation in the Far East. _The Proof_ brings us quickly back to the West, where two punks, plus a new recruit, take control of a local supermarket with dire consequences for the hostages. These two fast-paced, edgy works are as different as night and day. Nevertheless—as well as sex, identity, and modern-day economics figuring deeply in both—deep currents connect the two novellas: our little Buddhist monk remarks, “I told you it was easy. When something is easy, it is completely easy. But no one believes it. Not even the proof convinces them.” He will be joined by Heather Cleary, whose translations include Sergio Chejfec’s _The Planets_ (finalist, BTBA 2013) and _The Dark_ (nominee, National Translation Award 2014), and a selection of Oliverio Girondo’s poetry for New Directions. She teaches at Sarah Lawrence College and has served as a judge for the BTBA and the PEN Translation Award. She is a founding member of the Cedilla & Co. translator collective and a founding editor of the digital, bilingual _Buenos Aires Review._
