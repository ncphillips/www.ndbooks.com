Rivka Galchen, Francisco Goldman, and Idra Novey will discuss the challenges and benefits of moving between fiction and other genres and how that movement can lead to new ways of thinking about the novel as a form. Each will read from their most recent books and talk about writing fiction while also working on essays, journalism, poetry, and translation.
