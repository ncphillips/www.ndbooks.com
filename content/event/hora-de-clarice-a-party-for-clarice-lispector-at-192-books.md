Please join New Directions and 192 Books as we raise a glass in honor of Clarice Lispector's birthday. There will be books and bubbly flowing and spirits will be high! It's a lovely chance to reflect on the overwhelming response to _The Complete Stories of Clarice Lispector_ translated by Katrina Dodson and edited by Benjamin Moser.

_Hora de Clarice_ has been running in Brazil for the last five years with simultaneous celebrations in Paris, Madrid, Lisbon, Frankfurt, Buenos Aires, and Mexico City. This is the first celebration in New York.
