On the occasion of the publication of _The Hideous Hidden_, please join Sylvia Legris and Will Alexander for an evening of reading and conversation at Poets House in New York.

In her first full-length collection published in the United States, Sylvia Legris probes and peels, carves and cleaves, amputates and dissects, to reveal the poetic potential of human and animal anatomy.

Starting with the Greek writings of Hippocrates and the Latin language of medicine, and drawing from Leonardo da Vinci’s _Anatomical Manuscripts_, the dermatologist Robert Willan’s _On Cutaneous Diseases_ (1808), and Baudelaire’s _The Flowers of Evil_, Legris infuses each poem with unique rhythms that roll off the tongue. _The Hideous Hidden_ boldly celebrates anatomy’s wonders: “Renounce the vestibule of non-vital vitals. / Confess the gallbladder, / the glandular wallflowers, / the objectionable oblong spleen."

"Anatomical and medical language, cold and clinical in other contexts, becomes sensuous musical terrain; the sonic atmosphere Legris creates is as thick and slippery as the innards she describes."— _Publisher's Weekly_

Sylvia Legris was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and now lives in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Her collection _Nerve Squall_ won both the 2006 Griffin Poetry Prize and the 2006 Pat Lowther Award. Her poems have appeared in many publications, including _The New Yorker_, _Granta_, _Poetry_, and _Conjunctions_. She lives in Saskatoon.

Will Alexander is not easily categorized. In addition to being a poet, he is also a novelist, essayist, aphorist, playwright, philosopher, visual artist, and pianist. His influences range from poetic practitioners, such as Aimé Césaire, Bob Kaufman, Andre Breton, Antonin Artaud, and Philip Lamantia, to the encompassing paradigm of Sri Aurobindo’s Integral Yoga, and the Egyptian worldview as understood by Cheikh Anta Diop and R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz. He lives in _The City of Angels_.
