_Memory_ is a poetic audio-visual installation, shown now in its entirety for the first time since its original 1972 exhibition. During July 1971, Mayer took one roll of film each day, resulting in 1,116 photographs displayed in a grid. The photographs are accompanied by six hours of audio narration, created by Mayer as she remembers and circularly ruminates on the images, using them “as taking-off points for digression, filling in the spaces between.”
