Pegasus Books hosts an evening of reading and discussion with Michael McGregor, author of _Pure Act: The Uncommon Life of Robert Lax_. McGregor's new biography is a thoughtful study of a man whose joyful and influential poetry earned him praise as "one of Americaâ€™s greatest experimental poets."

"McGregor eloquently offers the definitive biography of a too often forgotten figure who influenced a number of writers and crafted spirituality out of his deep commitment to love, poverty, and justice."-- _Publishers Weekly_
