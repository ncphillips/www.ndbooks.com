An evening with two poets also highly regarded for their prose.

“No other poet now writing has Susan Howe’s power to bring together narrative and lyric, scholarship and historical speculation, found text and pure invention,” wrote Marjorie Perloff. Howe’s new essay collection is _The Quarry_. Ben Lerner has written three books of poetry (most recently _Mean Free Path_) and two novels (_Leaving Atocha Station_ and _10:04_) “A writer of true originality,” wrote Jeffrey Eugenides. “He is a courageous, immensely intelligent artist who panders to no one and yet is a delight to read.”
