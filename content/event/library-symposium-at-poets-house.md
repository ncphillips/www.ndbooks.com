An afternoon spent in silence? A-Z? The cosmic order of Borges' library of the imagination? Whatever the duration, extent, or dimensions of your perfect library, this day-long symposium will delight and inform as it winds through the many roles libraries take on in the community of readers and in the imagination, as collection, as shared intellectual and physical space, and as the symbol of shared knowledge.
