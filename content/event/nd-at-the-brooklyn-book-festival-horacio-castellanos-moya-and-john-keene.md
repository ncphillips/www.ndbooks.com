New Directions will be tabling at booth 331 all day, and we are presenting two events:

**10 am: "**Inventing History in New Fiction presented by Community Bookstore": John Keene, Susan Daitch, and Jeremy Davies. Moderated by Christian Lorentzen.

Whether inventing the past from scratch or rewriting its particulars, the avant-garde has long used history as a stage of fruitful experimentation. Contemporary writers are finding new ways to explore a diverse range of topics—from memory and revision to the anecdote and apocrypha—against the backdrop of American and world histories. Three cutting edge writers John Keene (_Counternarratives_), Susan Daitch (_The Lost Civilization of Suolucidir_), and Jeremy M. Davies (_The Knack of Doing_) read from and discuss their new work. Moderated by Christian Lorentzen, _New York Magazine_’s book critic.

St. Francis College Auditorium, 180 Remsen St

**3 pm** "Obsession": Idra Novey, Horacio Castellanos Moya, and Patricia Engel. Moderated by Eric Banks.

A bitter exile broods over his lost homeland in a dark bar; a translator travels to Brazil to search for a lost author; a bereaved sister dissects her brother's crime and death sentence. What is obsession in literature, and what forms does it take in recent works by Salvadoran writer Horacio Castellanos Moya (_Revulsion: Thomas Bernhard in El Salvador_), American writer Idra Novey (_Ways to Disappear_), and American Patricia Engel (_The Veins of the Ocean_), Moderated by Eric Banks.

Borough Hall Media Room (209 Joralemon Street)
