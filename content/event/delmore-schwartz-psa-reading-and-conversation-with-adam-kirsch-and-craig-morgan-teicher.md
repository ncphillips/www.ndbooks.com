With much of Delmore Schwartz's work out of print for decades,_[Once and For All: The Best of Delmore Schwartz](http://www.ndbooks.com/book/once-and-for-all-the-best-of-delmore-schwartz/)_ restores a missing chapter in the history of twentieth-century American literature. Join us for a reading and conversation with Craig Morgan Teicher, the editor of the _Once and For All_, and fellow Schwartz admirer, Adam Kirsch.

**Craig Morgan Teicher** is the author of several books of poems and prose, most recently _To Keep Love Blurry_. He is the editor of _Once and For All: The Best of Delmore Schwartz_.

**Adam Kirsch** is the author of three books of poems, most recently _Emblems of the Passing World: Poems after Photographs by August Sander._ He is the author of _The Wounded Surgeon: Confession and Transformation in Six American Poets_, which includes a study of the work of Delmore Schwartz.

Admission is free.
