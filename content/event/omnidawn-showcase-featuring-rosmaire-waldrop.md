Rosmarie Waldrop was born in Germany in 1935, and immigrated into the US in 1958. She has a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from the University of Michigan and has taught at Wesleyan, Tufts, and Brown Universities. She lives in Providence, Rhode Island, with Keith Waldrop (with whom she also co-edits Burning Deck Press).

She has received awards or fellowships from the NEA, the Fund for Poetry, the Howard Foundation, the DAAD Berlin Artists’ Program, the Foundation of Contemporary Arts, and a Lila Wallace-Reader’s Digest Writers’ Award. She has been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the French government has made her a “Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres.”

Waldrop's most recent collection, _Gap Gardening_, spans forty years of her innovative work. For the first time, we have a complete and clear view of the work of a great and inquiring, brave and indispensable poet.
