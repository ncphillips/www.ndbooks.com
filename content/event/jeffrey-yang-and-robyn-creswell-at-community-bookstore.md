Jeffrey Yang and Robyn Creswell join Community Bookstore to discuss two important books they translated for New Directions. _Open Up, City Gate_ (Yang) is Bei Dao’s lyrical autobiography--a beautiful memory palace of endless alleyways and corridors--where personal narrative mixes with China’s momentous history. Abdelfattah Kilito’s _The Tongue of Adam_ (Creswell) considers the genesis of multilingualism through the historical debates on the language of the first man: Adam.

**Jeffrey Yang** is the author of the poetry collections _Vanishing-Line_ and _An Aquarium_, winner of the PEN/Joyce Osterweil Award. He is the translator of Ahmatjan Osman’s _Uyghurland_, the _Farthest Exile_ (with the author), Liu Xiaobo’s _June Fourth Elegies_, Su Shi’s _East Slope_, and Bei Dao’s autobiography _City Gate, Open Up_. He is also the editor of the anthologies _Birds, Beasts, and Seas: Nature Poems_ and _Time of Grief: Mourning Poems_, and the collection _The Sea Is a Continual Miracle: Sea Poems and Other Writings_ by Walt Whitman (forthcoming, 2017). Yang works as an editor at New Directions and New York Review Books.

A critic, translator, and scholar, **Robyn Creswell** has written about contemporary poetry and fiction for Harper’s, The Nation, Raritan, n+1, and other magazines. During a fellowship at the Cullman Center at the New York Public Library, he translated Sonallah Ibrahim’s _That Smell_ and _Notes from Prison_. He has also translated Abdelfattah Kilito’s _The Clash of Images_ from the French. Creswell is currently the poetry editor for The Paris Review and Assistant Professor of Comparative Literature at Brown University.
