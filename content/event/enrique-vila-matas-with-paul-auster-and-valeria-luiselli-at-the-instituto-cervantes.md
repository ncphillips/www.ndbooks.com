Please join us at the Instituto Cervantes for a celebration of _Vampire in Love_ by Enrique Vila-Matas.

On Wednesday, October 5th, Valeria Luiselli will moderate a conversation between Paul Auster and Enrique Vila-Matas. The event will take place in Spanish, with simultaneous translation.

_Vampire in Love_ is a selection of the Spanish master's finest short stories. An effeminate, hunchbacked barber on the verge of death falls in love with a choirboy. A fledgling writer on barbiturates visits Marguerite Duras’s Paris apartment and watches his dinner companion slip into the abyss. An unsuspecting man receives a mysterious phone call from a lonely ophthalmologist, visits his abandoned villa, and is privy to a secret. Brilliantly translated by the renowned translator Margaret Jull Costa, the stories are all told with Vila-Matas’s signature erudition and wit and his provocative questioning of the interrelation of art and life.

Paul Auster is a novelist, essayist, translator, and poet whose complex mystery novels are often concerned with the search for identity and personal meaning. A graduate from Columbia University, he currently resides in Brooklyn, NY.

Valeria Luiselli is a novelist and non-fiction writer. She is the author of _Sidewalks_, _The Story of My Teeth_, and the internationally acclaimed novel _Faces in the Crowd_. Luiselli’s short fiction and non-fiction pieces have appeared in publications such as _The New York Times, Granta_ and _McSweeney’s_. Her work has been translated to multiple languages.
