The Center for the Art of Translation welcomes **Horacio Castellanos Moya** and his translator **Katherine Silver** to San Francisco to discuss Castellanos Moya's work, including his latest book, _The Dream of My Return,_ which Charles Finch of _The New York Times Book Review_ called "easily his best to appear in English so far."
