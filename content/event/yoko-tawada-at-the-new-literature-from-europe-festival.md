Yoko Tawada will be performing at The New Literature from Europe Festival. This annual festival features readings and discussions between leading and emerging literary voices from Europe, and some of Americaâ€™s foremost writers and critics. NLE celebrates important new European literature in translation such as Tawada's forthcoming novel, _Memoirs of a Polar Bear,_ which will be available in November.
