**Yoko Tawada** will be speaking at the upcoming translation panel, New Literature from Europe Presents: From One Language to Another, at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe.

The event is hosted in coordination with ALTA and the Nuyorican. Tickets are $8 in advance on their website and $12 at the door.

**Yoko Tawada** was born in Tokyo in 1960, moved to Hamburg when she was twenty-two, and then to Berlin in 2006. She writes in both Japanese and German, and has published several books—stories, novels, poems, plays, essays—in both languages. She has received numerous awards for her writing including the Akutagawa Prize, the Adelbert von Chamisso Prize, the Tanizaki Prize, and the Goethe Medal. New Directions publishes her story collections _Where Europe Begins_ (with a Preface by Wim Wenders) and _Facing the Bridge_, and her novel of Catherine Deneuve obsession, _The Naked Eye_.
