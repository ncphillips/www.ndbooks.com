After an introduction by Candace Slater (Spanish and Portuguese), Dodson will speak briefly about translating _The Complete Stories_ and then open the floor for discussion. Dodson’s recent translation of Clarice Lispector’s _Complete Stories_ collects for the first time all 85 short stories by one of Brazil’s most important writers, from Lispector’s first published story in 1939 at the age of 19 to her last written in 1977.
