The final concert of the 2017 Cutting Edge Concerts New Music Festival features the **Cygnus Ensemble** in a program of "Offbeat Operas" by composers William Anderson, Frank Brickle, and the world premiere of Victoria Bond's _Sirens._

William Anderson's _Eight Rhythms, Settings_ is based on a set of poems by **Djuna Barnes** from 1915. Anderson's utilizes many kinds of contemporary idioms-- indie rock, Simon & Garfunkel, and a bit of minimalism as well.

**_Le Testament de Villon_ by Frank Brickle begins with the opera by George Antheil and Ezra Pound and condenses it to an essential version dramatically and musically. This is the New York City premiere of Brickle's opera.**

Victoria Bond's _Sirens_ draws upon Episode 11 of **James Joyce'**s _Ulysses_ as inspiration. This episode, along with the overall theme of Joyce's _Ulysses_, is about being an outsider who is scorned and reviled. He is also everyman or everywoman who feels apart and alone in the midst of a world that has no use for him or her.

Program:

William Anderson/Djuna Barnes _Eight Rhythms, Settings_
