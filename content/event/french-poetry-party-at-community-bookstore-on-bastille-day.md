Please join New Directions, NYRB Classics, and Archipelago Books for a French Poetry Party at Community Bookstore this Bastille Day. You'll find us rejoicing in great, lusty, and revelatory French verse in the courtyard on what we hope will be a hot summer's night...

"Bring glory to the love-drunk folks at home!"—Charles Baudelaire

"Love, something crazy comes to mind: I can't bear being on my best behavior."—Louise Labé

"The only reality is Beauty and its only perfect expression is Poetry. All the rest is a lie."—Stéphane Mallarmé
