_At Passages_ is Michael Palmer’s first book of poetry in seven years––and his first book with New Directions. A collection in seven parts, _At Passages_ explores the "hum of the possible-to-say," and, as its title suggests, delves particularly into the paths and meetings of language and meaning: "as much the unseen / as the visible / As much what has disappeared / as what remains."
