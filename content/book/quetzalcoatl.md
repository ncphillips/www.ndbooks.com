Now available for the first time as a paperbook, _Quetzalcoatl_ is D.H. Lawrence’s last "unpublished manuscript" and the early version of D.H. Lawrence’s great Mexican novel, _The Plumed Serpent_. Kate Burns is the widow of a failed Irish patriot, strong-minded and independent, who unlike the heroine of _The Plumed Serpent_, refuses to simply join the Mexican revolutionary movement based on a revival of the Aztec gods. _Quetzalcoatl_ is arguably one of Lawrence’s most feminist works: the rise of a revolution filtered through the consciousness of a woman of tremendous individuality. This edition includes an illuminating introduction and textual commentary by Sterling Professor of English at Yale, Louis Martz. "_The Plumed Serpent_," Martz says, "may be judged a success wtihin its own mode of existence. For a different sort of novel, we may turn now to _Quetzalcoatl_."
