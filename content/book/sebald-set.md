New Directions is delighted to announce beautiful new editions of these three classic Sebald novels, including his two greatest works, _The Emigrants_ and _The Rings of Saturn_. All three novels are distinguished by their translations, every line of which Sebald himself made pitch-perfect, slaving to carry into English all his essential elements: the shadows, the lambent fallings-back, nineteenth-century Germanic undertones, tragic elegiac notes, and his unique, quiet wit.
