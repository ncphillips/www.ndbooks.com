The legacy of cultural imperialism, the consequences of gender, and the marginalization of the conquered are themes that combine and comment, one on the other, in Rosmarie Waldrop’s remarkable new work, _A Key into the Language of America_. As "formally adventurous" (A.L. Nielson, _Washington Review_) as ever, German-born Waldrop has based her new collection on Rhode Island founder Roger Williams’s 1643 guide (of the same name) to Narragansett Indian language and lore.
