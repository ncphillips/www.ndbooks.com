Spanning her entire career to date, _All the Stories of Muriel Spark_ contains four brand new tales. Now in hand is every single one of her forty-one marvelous stories. "To read Spark," as the _Georgia Review_ put it, "is to encounter delight after delight." Ranging from South Africa to the West End, her dazzling stories feature hanging judges, fortune-tellers, shy girls, psychiatrists, dress designers, pensive ghosts, never-departing guests, and imaginary chauffeurs. Regarding one story ("The Portobello Road"), Stephen Schiff said in _The New Yorker_: "Muriel Spark has written some of the best sentences in English. For instance: ’He looked as if he would murder me, and he did.’ It’s a nasty piece of work, that sentence."
