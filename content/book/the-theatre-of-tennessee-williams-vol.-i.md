_The Theatre of Tennessee Williams_ brings together in a matching format the plays of one of America’s most influential and innovative dramatists. Arranged in chronological order, this ongoing series includes the original cast listings and production notes. _Volume 1_ leads with _Battle of Angels_, Williams’ first produced play (1940), an early version of _Orpheus Descending_. This is followed by the texts of his first great popular successes: _The Glass Menagerie_ (1945) and the Pulitzer Prize-winning _A Streetcar Named Desire_ (1947), which established Williams’s reputation once and for all as a genius of the modern American theatre.
