Part springtime journal (“why are there thorns?”), _Works and Days_ meditates on the first wasps and chipmunks of the season, times’ passage, grackle hearts, and dandelions, while also collecting dozens of poems considering the Catholic Church, Sir Thomas Browne, “Go Away” welcome mats, books, floods (“never of dollar money”), the invention of words, local politics, friendships, property development, dogs, and Hesiod. Every page delights. As the poet herself notes: “My name is Bernadette Mayer, sometimes / I am at the head of my class.”

_I don’t mean to get all_

_Parallel universey on you_

_But I am at once the spider_

_The spider web, and_

_Me observing them_
