Throughout four consecutive decades, New Directions in Prose and Poetry has been at the very core of the ND list. Each volume, in essence a literary magazine in book form and international in character, has presented year after year the work of writers who have sought to extend the frontiers of method and content. This latest number, the twenty-fourth, draws on authors from seven different nations to produce a broad spectrum of prose, poetry, and drama. Among its highlights are Edouard Roditi’s "The Vampires of Istanbul," an amusing satire of epistolatory feuds: Jürgen Becker’s Margins, a complete "Text" by one of West Germany’s most influential avant-garde writers; "Nine Poems" by Attila József, a selection representing a chronology in brief of the pre-World War II Hungarian poet’s work; and "Four Poems" by Elio Pagliarani, a leading Italian poet associated with the experimental "Gruppo 63." Included, too, are stories by Alain Arias-Misson, E. M. Beckman, Benjamin Haimowitz, Yumiko Kurahashi (Japan), Jay Peter Olwyler, Nancy Willard, and William Witherup; poems by Douglas Blazek, Carlos Bousoño (Spain), Peter Glassgold, Daniel Halpern, James Purdy, Aleksis Rannit (Estonia), John Ratti, and John Taggart; a verse play by Edwin Honig; and a short drama by Junichiro Tanizaki (Japan).
