The thirty-eight tales of _Cinema Stories_ combine fact and fiction, and they all revolve around movie-making. The book compresses a lifetime of feeling, thought, and practice: Kluge— considered the father of New German Cinema—is an inventive wellspring of narrative notions. "The power of his prose," as _Small Press_ noted, "exudes the sort of pregnant richness one might find in the briefest scenarios of unknown films." _Cinema Stories_ is a treasure box of cinematic lore and movie magic by "Alexander Kluge, that most enlightened of writers" (W. G. Sebald).
