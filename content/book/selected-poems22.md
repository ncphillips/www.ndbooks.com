The late Kenneth Rexroth (1905-1982) is surely one of the most readable of this century’s great American poets. He is also one of the most sophisticated. Like William Carlos Williams, he honed his writing to a controlled and direct language. His intellectual complexity matches Wallace Stevens, his polymath erudition Ezra Pound. He is first among our nature poets. His love poems and erotic lyrics are unsurpassed. Rexroth’s _Selected Poems_ brings together in a single volume a representative sampling of sixty years’ work. Here are substantial passages from his longer poems: _The Homestead Called Damascus_ (1920-1925), begun while the poet was in his teens; the cubist _Prolegomenon to a Theodicy_ (1925-1927); the philosophical masterpiece _The Phoenix and the Tortoise_ (1940-1944) and _The Dragon and the Unicorn_ (1944-1950); and the meditative _The Heart’s Garden, The Garden’s Heart_ (1967). The shorter poems were originally gathered in _In What Hour_ (1940), _The Art of Wordly Wisdom_ (1949), _The Signature of All Things_ (1950), _In Defense of the Earth_ (1956), _Natural Numbers_ (1964), _New Poems_ (1974), and _The Morning Star_ (1979).
