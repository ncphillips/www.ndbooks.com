Often reported to be on the short list for the Nobel Prize in Literature, and recently elected an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Bei Dao is China’s pre-eminent contemporary poet. The poems of _Landscape Over Zero_ reach new heights of cinematic fusion as "a powerful compression drives these jostling contrasts in fractured resonating landscapes” (_The Reading Lamp_). Bei Dao’s unique voice and imagery are at once more lyrical and more poignant than in past collections. Thoughts of futility, distance, and coldness wrestle with a resignation that home has been lost. But now there is the glimmer of possibility that a new home can be gained and love renewed.
