A collection in five parts, Susan Howe’s electrifying new book opens with a preface by the poet that lays out some of _Debths_’ inspirations—the art of Paul Thek, the Isabella Stewart Gardner collection, and early American writings— and also addresses memory’s threads and galaxies and “the luminous story surrounding all things noumenal.”

Following the preface are four sections of poetry: “Titian Air Vent,” “Tom Tit Tot” (her newest collage poems), “Periscope,” and “Debths.” As always with Howe, _Debths_ brings “a not-being-in-the-no.”
