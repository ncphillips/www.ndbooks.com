The epigraph to _Later_, Robert Creeley’s second book of poems published by New Directions, enjoins the reader to "hold in mind/ All that has loved you or been kind." This commitment to the continuity of life on a fragile planet, limited by both time and space, has become increasingly important to a poet who, "if older," takes a certain pride in knowing the boundaries of the possible. Where his 1978 verse journal Hello chronicled an actual journey (to New Zealand, Australia, and the Far East), _Later_ deals with an interior exploration rooted in everyday sights and sounds––the play of light and shadow through a window, the lap of waves on a beach. Past occurrences and expectations are reconciled with an acceptance of inevitable change, and in the poignant title sequence Creeley marvels, "but now the wonder of life is/ that it is at all."
