A "melo-melo in seven scenes," _Just Wild About Harry_ is Henry Miller’s only excursion into playwriting. _Harry_ is pure Miller, welling up from the same abundant love of life and freedom from convention that made its author the dean of writers dedicated to human liberation. Admittedly inspired by lonesco and the Theatre of the Absurd, Miller’s tragicomic slapstick is nevertheless as American as the Marx Brothers and the blues––the simple story of a heartless Harry (the one the ladies are wild about) who learns a bittersweet lesson about life, death, and love. Begun in Europe in 1960, _Just Wild About Harry_ was first published by New Directions in 1963.
