Not just for students and doctors, this volume contains the thirteen "doctor stories" from the collected stories (_The Farmers’ Daughters_), several of Williams’s most famous poems on medical matters, and "The Practice" from _The Autobiography_. These writings, together with Dr. Robert Coles’s enthusiastic appraisal of teaching Williams and Dr. William Eric Williams’s personal and touching filial account, "My Father, the Doctor," make up an intriguing and timely study of the poet as a physician of rare humanity and self-knowledge. As Coles suggests, Dr. Williams’s writing can help many others take a knowing look at the medical profession.
