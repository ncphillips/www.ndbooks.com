_Tesserae_, the small individual pieces of glass or stone that make up a mosaic, is an apt title for this series of memoirs by Denise Levertov. Rather than being a completed autobiography, these collected memoirs are, for the author, fragments of an unfinished mosaic. Each of the twenty-seven pieces of _Tesserae_ explores a memory vital to Levertovâ€™s life; each is complete in itself and set here chronologically. And, as in any good mosaic, each piece reflects at different angles creating a play of light which gives this self-portrait its living complexity. _Tesserae_ offers for the first time the unique memoirs of "a poet who may just be the finest writing in English today." (_Kirkus Reviews_).
