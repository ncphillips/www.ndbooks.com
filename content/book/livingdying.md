The poet Cid Corman has written: "Poetry calls for anonymity. It appeals, in short, to the each in all and the all in each. Its particularity must become yours. My song must sing into you a little moment, stay in you what presence can muster––of sense more than meaning, of love more than sense, of giving the life given one with the same fullness that brought each forth, each to each from each, nothing left but the life that is going on."
