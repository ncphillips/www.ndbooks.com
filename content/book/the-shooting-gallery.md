The eight powerful stories of _The Shooting Gallery_ examine the lives of single women coping with motherhood, passion, jealousy, and the tug-of-war between responsibility and entrapment. An unwed mother arranges for her children to meet their father, who is a stranger to them. A woman confronts the "other woman" in her loverâ€™s life. A young single mother on an outing to the seaside comes face to face with how much she resents her own children. Another woman tries desperately to hold on to a private life despite her controlling male relatives.
