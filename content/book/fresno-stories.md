Eleven of William Saroyan’s most delightful tales, _Fresno Stories_ spring straight from the source of the authors vision––“the archetypal Armenian families who inhabit Saroyan country, in and around Fresno, California. [And yet with their] unpredictable charm and wacky spontaneity…his characters overflow with so much human comedy that they transcend all ethnic boundaries, as in the stories of I.B. Singer” (_The Chicago Tribune_). Selected from New Directions’ collections of Saroyan’s early stories (_The Man with the Heart in the Highlands_) and his later work (_Madness in the Family_), Fresno Stories spans his whole remarkable career. "These stories shine with the old Saroyan luminousness, which is to say with an insight as fresh as that of an unusually perceptive child" (_The San Francisco Chronicle_).
