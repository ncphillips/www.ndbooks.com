When first published in 2000, Volume I of _The Selected Letters of Tennessee Williams_ was hailed as "indispensable" (_Choice_), a "carefully researched, fully documented study" (_Buffalo News_), and "a model edition of a significant set of letters by one of America’s leading writers" (MLA citation for the biennial Morton N. Cohen Award). Now available as a paperbook, it is hoped that this volume will help a widening circle of readers appreciate that the great American playwright was also "a prodigy of the letter" (Allan JaIon, _San Francisco Chronicle_). Tennessee Williams wrote to family, friends, and fellow artists with varying measures of piety, wit, and astute self-knowledge. Presented with a running commentary to separate Williams’s sometimes hilarious, often devious, counter-reality from truth, the letters form a virtual autobiography of the great American dramatist. Volume I of _The Selected Letters of Tennessee Williams: 1920-1945_ includes 330 letters written to nearly seventy correspondents and chosen from a group of 900 letters collected by two leading Williams scholars: Albert J. Devlin, Professor of English at the University of Missouri, and Nancy M. Tischler, Professor Emerita of English at the Pennsylvania State University.
