Ezra Pound is destined to rank as one of the great translators of all time.

This new enlarged edition, devoted chiefly to poetry, includes some forty pages of previously uncollected material. Anglo-Saxon: _The Seafarer_. Chinese: (Cathay) Rihaku (Li Po). Bunno, Mei Sheng, T’ao Yuan Ming. Egyptian: _Conversations in Courtship_. French: du Bellay, de Boufflers, D’Orléans, Lalorgue, Lubicz-Milosz, Rimbaud, Tailhade. Prose: de Gourmont. Hindi: Kabir. Italian: Cavalcanti, St. Francis, Guinicelli, Leopardi, Montanari, Orlandi. Japanese Noh Plays: 15 plays with Fenollosa’s commentary. Latin: Catullus, Horace, Navagero, Rutilius. Provençal: Bertrand de Born, Cercalmon, Daniel, Folquet de Romans, Li Viniers, Ventadorn.
