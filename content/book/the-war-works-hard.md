"Yesterday I lost a country," Dunya Mikhail writes in _The War Works Hard_, a subversive, sobering work by an exiled Iraqi poet, and her first collection to appear in English. Amidst the ongoing atrocities in Iraq, after decades of wars and hundreds of thousands of deaths, here is an important new voice that rescues the human spirit from the ruins. Embracing literary traditions from ancient Mesopotamian mythology to Biblical and Koranic parables, and to Western modernism, Mikhailâ€™s poetic vision transcends cultural and linguistic boundaries with liberating compassion.
