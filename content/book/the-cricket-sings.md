A special aspect of Federico Garcia Lorcaâ€™s personality was the ease with which he made friends with children and the delight he took in entertaining them. In addition to the little puppet shows he created for his sisters and their friends and for the children of other writers, he wrote many little poems as well as words set to folk tunes that are still read and sung by Spanish children today and which, in their rarity and charm, are just the right size for anyone of any age.
