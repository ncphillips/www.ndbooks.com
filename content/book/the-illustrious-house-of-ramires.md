"Eça de Queiros (1845-1900) ought to be," as the _London Observer_ stated, "up there with Balzac, Dickens, and Tolstoy as one of the talismanic names of the nineteenth century." His superlative penultimate novel, _The Illustrious House of Ramires_ (1900) centers on Gonçalo Ramires, heir to the most noble family of Portugal. Gonçalo, charming but disastrously effete, muddles through his life while writing a historical novel based on the heroic deeds of his ancestors. "The record of their valour is ironically counterpointed by his own chicanery. A combination of Don Quixote and Walter Mitty, he is continually humiliated [but he] is at the same time kindhearted .... Ironic comedy is the keynote of the novel .... Eça de Queiros has justly been compared with Flaubert and Stendhal."(_The London Spectator_)
