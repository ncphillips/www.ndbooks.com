Two remarkable prose stylists — friends since high school — transform found material from the nineteenth century into mesmerizing poem-essays.

> It was given to me, in the nineteenth century, to spend a lifetime on his
> earth. Along with a few of the sorrows that are appointed unto men,
> I have had innumerable enjoyments; and the world has been to me,
> even from childhood, a great museum.
> — Lydia Davis
> 
> Bad rapids. Bradley is knocked over the side; his foot catches under
> the seat and he is dragged, head under water. Camped on a sand
> beach, the wind blows a hurricane. Sand piles over us like a snowdrift.
> — Eliot Weinberger
