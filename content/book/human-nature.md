_Human Nature_ is the first book of new poems by the poet and novelist Toby Olson since _We Are the Fire_ (New Directions. 1984). The intervening years saw five of his novels published to strong critical acclaim. "But," says Olson, "one day I woke from fiction to discover I’d not written a poem in close to ten years. How to return to poetry after being away from it so long?" Certainly not in repetition of things done before. In _Human Nature_, Olson joins the novelist’s art to the poet’s through remembrances of friends and events in times gone by. "In _Human Nature_," he says, "even the most autobiographical poems let fiction in."
