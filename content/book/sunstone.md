Nobel laureate Octavio Paz’s premier long poem _Sunstone/Piedra de Sol_ is here printed as a separate volume, with beautiful illustrations from an eighteenth-century treatise on the Mexican calendar. Presented in Eliot Weinberger’s excellent new translation with the Spanish texts en face, this is the 1957 poem "that definitively established Paz as a major international figure" (_Sagetrieb_). Written as a single cyclical sentence (at the end of the poem the first six lines are written again), _Sunstone_ is a tour de force of momentum. It takes as its structural basis the circular Aztec calendar, which measured the synodic period of the planet Venus (584 days––the number of lines of _Sunstone_). But, as _The New Republic_ noted, "this esoteric correlative design... does not circumscribe its subject. [It is] a lyrically discursive exploration of time and memory, of erotic love, of art and writing."
