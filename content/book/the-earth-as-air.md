"Earth, the dense element of our residence, our realities, raised, heightened, transformed––by language alone––into its spacious complement: air"––with this succinct remark Gustaf Sobin suggests his intentions in his newest collection. Word chases word in the poet’s search for the transcendent. In lyric transformation, the poems in _The Earth as Air_ arise out of the particular, the graphic, the intensely perceived, turning experience into the weightless particles of a new, intellective music.
