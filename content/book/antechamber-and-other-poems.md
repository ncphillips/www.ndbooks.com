_Antechamber and Other Poems_, Michael McClure’s latest book with New Directions, joins a growing list of contributions that includes the verse collection _September Blackberries_ (1974) and _Jaguar Skies_ (1975) as well as the musical play _Gorf_ (1976). His writing in recent years is "alchemical" in its intent, yet his twin declarations, "Biology Is Politics" and "I Am A Mammal Patriot," perhaps express more accurately both the universality of his outlook and its humane particularity. McClure’s mysticism is vigorously scientific. Even the familiar patterned shapes of his poems remind us of the stars in the night sky and those we see when we shut our eyes. In the dancing lines of his newest work––the title poem "Antechamber" most especially––are the whirl of galaxies, the radiance of molecules, the energy lines of the double helix coiling around its core.
