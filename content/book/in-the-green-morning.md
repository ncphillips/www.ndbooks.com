In _In the Green Morning: Memories of Federico_, Francisco García Lorca tells of the charmed childhood he, his sisters, and his older brother, the Spanish poet and playwright Federico García Lorca, spent in the quiet, very fragrant Andalusian village of Fuente Vaqueros. A wealth of local characters and anecdotes, later immortalized in Federico’s poems and plays, are brought to life in an intimate, conversational style. Digressions into family history enable us to see Federico—the son of a well-off landowning family with a tradition of literacy, poetry-writing, and musical accomplishment—as the culmination of a particular family type his brother describes as being “happy, spontaneous, and instinctive,” The Lorca family eventually moved to Granada, where both brothers attended the university. However, real education took place at the vividly described deliberations of the “Back Corner” group of the Granadan avant-garde. As the “green morning” of childhood and adolescence came to an end with Federico García Lorca’s first poetic successes, the brothers’ lives diverged; Francisco’s account ends with Federico’s departure for Madrid. Francisco went on to become a distinguished professor of Spanish at Columbia University, and the second half of this volume includes ten of his lectures on his brother’s work—discussions which draw upon his personal knowledge of the gradual gestations of the plays and his recollections of rehearsals where Federico was a skilled and precise director. This edition has been prepared and translated by Christopher Maurer of the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures, Harvard University, who also translated Lorca’s Deep Song and Other Prose. Also included is a Prologue by the Spanish poet Mario Hernández, a leading authority on Lorca’s work.
