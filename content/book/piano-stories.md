_Piano Stories_ presents fifteen wonderful works by the great Uruguayan author Felisberto Hernández, “a writer like no other,” as Italo Calvino declares in his introduction: “like no European or Latin American. He is an ‘irregular,’ who eludes all classifications and labelings — yet he is unmistakable on any page to which one might randomly open one of his books.” _Piano Stories_ contains classic tales such as “The Daisy Dolls,” “The Usher,” and “The Flooded House.”
