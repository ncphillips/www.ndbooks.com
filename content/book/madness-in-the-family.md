William Saroyan, who burst upon the scene with his celebrated short-story collection _The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze_ (1934), enjoyed a long and prolific literary career. Famous for his novels and plays (including _The Human Comedy_ and _The Time of Your Life_), he also published sixteen acclaimed story collections. "It came as something of a shock then, after the author’s death in 1981," the editor Leo Hamalian notes, "to realize Saroyan hadn’t published a collection of his stories since 1956, a period of twenty-five years that also represents a full half of his writing life." Gathered here are the finest of the masterly late pieces which appeared in _The New Yorker_, _Atlantic Monthly_, and _Harper’s_ in the 1960s and ’70s.
