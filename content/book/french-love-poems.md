In 1853, bursting with emotion, Charles Baudelaire confessed to his muse Madame Sabatier: “Sometimes, I can find relief only in composing verses for you.” Is there any better way of expressing feelings of passion and longing than with poetry? The French have excelled at this, resulting in a rich tradition of love poetry: theirs is the language of love.

Filled with devotion and lust, sensuality and eroticism, fever and overture, these poems showcase some of the most passionate verses in the French language. From the classic sixteenth-century love sonnets of Louise Labé, to the piercing lyricism of the Romantics, to the dreamlike compositions of the love-drunk Surrealists, _French Love Poems_ is the perfect, seductive gift for the one who makes your heart flutter.

_So what the door was guarded_

_So what we were imprisoned there_

_So what the street was barred off_

_So what the town was under attack_

_So what she was famished_

_So what we were without arms_

_So what night had fallen_

_So what we made love._

(Paul Éluard, translated by William Carlos Williams)

_Naked, then, she was to all of my worship,_

_Smiling in triumph from the heights of her couch_

_At my desire advancing, as gentle and deep_

_As the sea sending its waves to the warm beach._

(Charles Baudelaire)
