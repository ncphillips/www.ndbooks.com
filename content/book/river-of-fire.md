The most important novel of twentieth-century Urdu fiction, Qurratulain Hyder’s _River of Fire_ was first published as _Aag ka Darya_ in 1959. _River of Fire_ encompasses the fates of four recurring characters over two and a half millennia: Gautam, Champa, Kamal, and Cyril––Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, Christian. In different eras, different relations form and reform among the four: romance and war, possession and dispossession. Lyrical and witty, Hyder’s prose interweaves parables, legends, dreams, diaries, and letters. And she argues for a culture that is inclusive: _River of Fire_ is a book that questions the relevance of religion in defining Indian identity.
