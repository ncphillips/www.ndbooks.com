This reissue of the classic _Trilogy_, by H. D. (Hilda Doolittle, 1886-1961), now includes a new introduction and a large section of referential notes for readers and students, compiled by Professor Aliki Barnstone. As civilian war poetry (written under the shattering impact of World War II), _Trilogy’s_ three long poems rank with T. S. Eliot’s _Four Quartets_ and Ezra Pound’s _Pisan Cantos_. The first book of the _Trilogy_, published in the midst of the "fifty thousand incidents" of the London blitz, maintains the hope that though "we have no map;/ possibly we will reach haven,/heaven." _Tribute to the Angels_ describes new life springing from the ruins, and finally, in _The Flowering of the Rod_––with its epigram, "…pause to give/thanks that we rise again from death and live"––faith in love and resurrection is realized in lyric and strongly Biblical imagery. About _Trilogy_, Denise Levertov wrote: ". . . H. D. spoke of essentials. It is a simplicity not of reduction but of having gone further out of the circle of known light, further toward an unknown center."
