_The Heart Is Katmandu_ tells a tale of new love—of paradise gained. Set in today’s Haifa and presented in 237 dream-like small chapters, it is a book in which shyness and stumbling tenderness emerge triumphant. Poet Peter Cole has made a beautiful translation, capturing Hoffmann’s intense and unfathomably original style. A starred _Kirkus Review_ acclaimed the novel "Beautiful, humane, priceless."
