Now entering its fifth consecutive decade of publication, New Directions in Prose and Poetry continues to be at the very core of the ND list. The latest number in the series, the thirty-second, drawing on authors from five different nations, exhibits a broad spectrum of prose, poetry, and drama. Of special interest is the complete text of the late Delmore Schwartz’s verse play Shenandoah, which has been unavailable since its original publication twenty-five years ago. The other contributions include: a poem by Michael McClure, "Upon Reading William Carlos Williams’s ’Paterson’"; James B. Hall’s "The Executive Touch," a sardonic satire in an epistolary style; new verse by Lawrence Ferlinghetti; Gilbert Sorrentino’s "Orange Sonnets"; a group of poems by the Estonian poet Aleksis Rannit; Walter Abish’s "In So Many Words," a fictive exploration of syntax and semantics; five poems by Franco Fortini (Italy); "Singing in the Clump" a tale of childhood rivalries by Coleman Dowell; a minianthology, edited by Andrew Crozier, of young British poets; James Purdy’s "Green Knowledge," two interrelated prose poems; "Parcel of Wrists," an ambient narrative by Steve Katz; ten poems by Francisco Brines (Spain); verse by Gustaf Sobin.
