Beginning with the publication of _The Back Country_ in 1968, Gary Snyder’s long-cherished association with New Directions continued through the publication of his poetry books: the Pulitzer Prize-winning and bestselling _Turtle Island_ (1974), and _Myths & Texts_ (1978); as well as his prose works, _Earth House Hold_ (1969) and _The Real Work_ (1980), all essential titles on the New Directions list. More recently, Snyder’s _No Nature: New and Selected Poems_, a finalist for the National Book Award, was published in 1993 by Pantheon, and his long-anticipated epic poem _Mountains and Rivers without End_ was published by Counterpoint, 1997\. Snyder has had a seminal place among American landscape writers. "As a poet," he once wrote, "I hold the most archaic values on earth." He has long been associated with Beat writers such as Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and other poets such as Kenneth Rexroth, Robert Creeley, and Robert Duncan. His poetics are founded in Poundian modernism, Chinese and Japanese poetry, and ancient oral native traditions.
