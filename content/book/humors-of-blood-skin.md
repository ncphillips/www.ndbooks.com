For more than three decades, John Hawkes’s voice has been among the most original in American fiction. His work, including nine novels, such as _The Cannibal_, _The Lime Twig_, _Second Skin_, _The Blood Oranges_, and _Virginie: Her Two Lives_, has consistently demonstrated that he is a major prose stylist and a master of comedy and the unexpected. _Humors of Blood and Skin: A John Hawkes Reader_ presents Hawke’s own selection from his novels, stories, and his current novel-in-progress, _Adventures in the Alaskan Skin Trade_. In autobiographical commentaries, Hawkes provides a context for each of the selections and discusses the genesis and the writing of his work. As a novelist whose creative life has depended largely on travel, he evokes the actual places that have inspired his imaginary worlds: the Alaska of his boyhood; the Caribbean island where he wrote _Second Skin_; the Germany he knew as an ambulance driver in World War II; the South of France where he searched for images of Picasso and the Marquis de Sade. This Reader is both an introduction to Hawkes’s fiction and a singular literary montage, focused on comedy, eroticism, and the imagination. It is, as William H. Gass says in his introduction, "the joyful showing forth and celebration of Hawkes’s healing art."
