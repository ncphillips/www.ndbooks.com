Championed by Salman Rushdie in _The New Yorker_, Qurratulain Hyder is one of the "must reads" of Indian literature. _Fireflies in the Mist_ is Hyder’s capstone to her astonishing _River of Fire_, which was hailed by _The New York Review of Books_ as "magisterial with a technical resourcefulness rarely seen before in Urdu fiction." _Fireflies_ follows the creation of modern day Bangladesh – from Indian province, to Partition, to the emergence of statehood – as told through the impassioned voice of Deepali Sarkar and the others around her who live through the turbulence. Hyder perceptively and majestically follows the trajectory of Sarkar’s life – from her secluded upbringing in Dhaka to becoming a socialist rebel and to her ultimate transformation as a diasporic Bengali cosmopolitan – in the way that many of yesterday’s revolutionaries are slowly but surely ensnared within a net of class and luxury dangled in front of them.
