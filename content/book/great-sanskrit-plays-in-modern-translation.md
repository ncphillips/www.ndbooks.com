The wonderful world of classical Indian drama has been obscured for most readers by the stilted style of the existing 19th-century translations. Here, an Indian Sanskrit scholar, P. Lal, who is also a fine poet in his own right, has produced new versions in modern idiom which brings across the full richness and vitality of the originals. And these "transcreations" are so presented that they will "play" on our stage today. The volume contains: _Shakuntala_ by Kalidasa,Â _The Toy Cart_ by King Shudraka, _The Signet Ring of Rakshasa_ by Vishakadatta, _The Dream of Vasavadatta_ by Bhasa, _The Later Story of Rama_ by Bhavabhuti, and _Ratnavali_ by Harsha. Professor Lal (Xavier College, Calcutta) has provided an introduction on the history and aesthetic theory of Sanskrit drama, individual prefaces for each play, a phonetic guide to the pronunciation of the Indian names, and a selective bibliography.
