_The Poems of Octavio Paz_ is the first retrospective collection of Paz's poetry to span his entire writing career, from his first published poem, at age seventeen, to his magnificent last poem. This landmark bilingual edition contains many poems that have never been translated into English before, plus new translations based on Paz's final revisions. Assiduously edited by Eliot Weinberger—who has been translating Paz for over forty years—_The Poems of Octavio Paz_ also includes additional translations by the poet-luminaries Elizabeth Bishop, Paul Blackburn, Denise Levertov, Muriel Rukeyser, and Charles Tomlinson. Readers will also find Weinberger's capsule biography of Paz, as well as illuminating notes on many poems in Paz's own words taken from various interviews he gave throughout his long and singular life.
