This book of varied but related essay by one of the founders and editors of the Partisan Review reveals the modern critical intelligence under its most acute and telling aspect. With seven new essays, twenty in all, Philip Rahvâ€™s criticisms here range widely over European and American literature, discovering new connections. This is a volume of intrinsic value to anyone who is seriously interested in literature.
