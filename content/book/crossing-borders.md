_Crossing Borders_ presents the shorter work of acclaimed poet Peter Dale Scott. Scott––who can "achieve the quiet authority of the best later Williams" (_London Times Literary Supplement_) and who is renowned for his two epic, book-length poems _Coming to Jakarta_ and _Listening to the Candle_––appears here on an inviting new scale. Whether considering nature, death, love, memory, or the classical Chinese masters, each of the fifty-six poems of _Crossing Borders_ yields large pleasures within a small compass. This selected volume presents new dimensions of a poet "capable of true invention," as Thom Gunn has remarked, "[and] of interest to all who read poetry"
