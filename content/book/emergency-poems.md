_Emergency Poems_ is the Chilean poet Nicanor Parra’s second bilingual collection published by New Directions. The spare, often grim irony of the first _Poems and Antipoems_ (1967)—a wide selection gleaned from his four earliest books—established his reputation with a North American reading public used to the more formal language of conventional Spanish-speaking poets. Since then he has traveled extensively in this country, teaching, lecturing, and reading from his own work; while in Chile he received the 1969 Premio Nacional de Literatura (National Literature Prize) for his _Obra Gruesa_, from which many of the pieces in _Emergency Poems_ are drawn. In his introduction to this latest collection, Miller Williams, the translator, comments that Parra’s "poetry has moved and expanded as the imagination behind it has since the publication of _Poems and Antipoems_. Those who are familiar with Parra’s work will find the humor more sharply honed and darker, the anger closer to the surface and sometimes breaking through, the language tighter, the compassion deeper and the statements more political—or anyway more social."
