In its characters, themes, and preoccupations, _Final Exam_ prefigures Cortazar’s later fictions, including _Blow-Up_, and his masterpiece, _Hopscotch_. Written in 1950 (just before the fall of Peron’s government), it is Cortazar’s allegorical, bitter, and melancholy farewell to an Argentina from which he was about to be permanently self-exiled. (Cortazar moved to Paris the following year.) The setting is an eerie Buenos Aires that the books characters explore while being followed by a mysterious figure. With its daring typeography, its shifts in rhythm as well as in the wildly veering directions of its characters’ thoughts and speech, _Final Exam_ breaks new ground in the territory of stream-of-conciousness narrative techniques. It is considered one of Cortazar’s best works.
