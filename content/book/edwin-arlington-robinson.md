"In every way, the best analysis of Robinson yet written," commented The New Yorker when the original, shorter version of this volume was brought out by New Directions in 1946. "Winters," the review continued, "scrutinizes Robinson’s technique and background sensitively but firmly, and the result is a clarification of Robinson’s virtues and weaknesses that should be of great assistance to those who have found the poet dry and impenetrable." The revision of this critical guidebook to the work of one of our greatest modern American poets contains a generous sampling of his poems, some quoted in their entirety, and subject to the late Yvor Winters’ thorough, rational textual analysis.
