When Denise Levertov died on December 20, 1997, she left behind forty finished poems which form her last collection, _This Great Unknowing_. Few poets have possessed so great a gift or so great a body of work––upon her death at age 74, she had been a published poet for more than half a century. Although the poems of _This Great Unknowing_ were not organized by Levertov herself, as were the twenty collections she published with New Directions in her lifetime, the poems themselves shine with the artistry of a writer at the height of her powers.
