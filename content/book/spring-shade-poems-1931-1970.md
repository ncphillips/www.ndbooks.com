Robert Fitzgerald’s work first appeared in _Poetry_ forty years ago. Since then his controlled yet lyric voice, his intimacy with the classic tradition, have gained for him a distinguished reputation as poet and translator. In _Spring Shade_, he brings together all of his previous collections––_Poems_ (1935), _A Wreath for the Sea_ (1943), _In the Rose of Time_ (1956)––and adds to them two dozen later poems and a generous sampling from the wide range of his translations. Boylston Professor of Rhetoric at Harvard since 1965, Fitzgerald spends a part of each year with his family near Perugia, Italy, where he does most of his writing. He has received many honors in recent years, among them fellowship in the National Institute of Arts and Letters (1962) and the National Academy of Arts and Sciences (1963) and the first Bollingen Translation Award (1961) for his _Odyssey_.
