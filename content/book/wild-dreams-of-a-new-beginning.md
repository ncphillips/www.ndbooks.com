_Wild Dreams of a New Beginning_ brings together two acclaimed poetry volumes by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, one of our "ageless radicals and true bards" (_Booklist_). _Who Are We Now?_ (1976), the first half of _Wild Dreams_, takes a long poetic look at the cultural fallout of a more radical time. This probing of the changes in the American psyche through the 1970s is carried forward in the second part, _Landscapes of Living & Dying_ (1979)––a work originally hailed by _Library Journal_ as "Ferlinghetti’s strongest work since his 1957 _A Coney Island of the Mind_ .... [He] pursues his disheveled muse with the innocent passion of a young beatnik, hiding his authentic erudition behind a comfortable guise of spontaneous composition."
