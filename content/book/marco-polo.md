Published for the first time in this country, this book is a retelling of Marco Polo’s account of his travels through the Mongol Empire to the fabulous court of Kubla Khan. Into Polo’s remarkably objective report Mr. Collis, author of The Land of the Great Image and a Far East expect who has himself traveled over much of Polo’s route, has interwoven his own commentary and explanation to provide a much broader, more modern perspective. The result is a panoramic, authentic picture of 13th Century Asia as well as a lively portrait of the incredible Polo and a journey which remains as astonishing as any that history records.
