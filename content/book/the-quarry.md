A powerful selection of Susan Howe's previously uncollected essays, _The Quarry_ moves backward chronologically, from her brand-new "Vagrancy in the Park" (about Wallace Stevens) through such essential texts as "The Disappearance Approach," "Personal Narrative," "Sorting Facts," "Frame Structures," and "Where Should the Commander Be," and ending with her seminal early criticism, "The End of Art." The essays of _The Quarry_ map the intellectual territory of one of America's most important and vital avant-garde poets.
