The successive volumes of New Directions in Prose and Poetry, in essence a literary magazine in book form, have in the course of four decades served as vehicles for the presentation of new and variant trends in world literature. At a time when critics have been mourning the demise of the short story, the twenty-seventh number of the ND series includes an exciting and diversified selection of new American fiction that ranges from the impressionistic to the satirical and earthy. Featured are Walter Abish’s "More by George," Bruce Caldwell’s "The Members," Coleman Dowell’s "The Birthmark," John H. Galey’s "When You’re 3,000 Miles Away from Home," Peter Glassgold’s "Omelets Were His Speciality," and Edouard Roditi’s "An Ill that Traveled Far and Wide." Of the many poems contributed to the book, of special note are those by the British poet Edwin Brock; two new "political" pieces by Lawrence Ferlinghetti; the long work "Li Kan Speaks from Under the Tree" by the Swedish author Harry Martinson, translated by W. H. Auden and Leif Sjöberg; and Tennessee Williams’s "Old Men Go Mad at Night." From Italy are verses by Mario Luzi and Vittorio Sereni; from the United States, the poetry of David Antin, Nicholas Bellitto, Hilda Morley, and Edgar Simmons. Finally, representing radical prose techniques, are "The List" by Rüdiger Kremer (West Germany) and "Entropisms" by Harriet Zinnes (United States).
