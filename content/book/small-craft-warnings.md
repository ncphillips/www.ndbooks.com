Tennessee Williams’s _Small Craft Warnings_ is based on one of the shorter works, "Confessional," originally published in his collection _Dragon Country_ in 1969. Expanded into a full "evening," it was produced off-Broadway in the spring of 1972, and audiences and critics alike were moved by one of the playwright’s most searching works. Monk’s Place, a bar somewhere on the Pacific coast of California, provides the setting in which a group of ordinary, sometimes defeated, and often courageous castoffs grapple with existence and survival. Included in this edition are a foreword and afterword and a selection from the playwright’s correspondence, all of which serve to illustrate the genesis and evolution of the play.
