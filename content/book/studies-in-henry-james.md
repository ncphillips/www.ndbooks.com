_Studies in Henry James_ collects for the first time all the writings by R. P. Blackmur (1904-1965), a pioneer of New Criticism and major literary force of our century, on Henry James (1843-1916), author of such classic novels as _The Europeans_, _The Portrait of a Lady_, and _The Ambassadors_. Blackmur’s "first elated reading" of James in 1921 left the young man "both confident and desperate in the force of art." In the ensuing years, his approach to James grew warier, yet "the Master" remained for him a singular "haunt and a presence." Although his originally projected book for New Directions never materialized, Blackmur did complete articles, essays, and introductions over the years which, assembled here, brilliantly illuminated the wide spectrum of James’s work. Arranged chronologically are "The Critical Prefaces of Henry James" (1934)," "The Sacred Fount" (1942), "In the Country of the Blue" (1943) on James’s conception of his art, "Henry James" (from the 1948 _Macmillan Literary History of the United States_), "The Loose and Baggy Monsters of Henry James" (1951) on style, and introductions to the eight Laurel editions of James’s novels (1958-64) and to the 1952 Grove Press edition of _The Golden Bowl_. An appendix contains "The Spoils of Henry James: A Special Case of the Normal," an unfinished essay, probably composed as a preface to the original New Directions book, and published here for the first time. Blackmur’s consistently lyrical and acute presentations insure the lasting value of _Studies in Henry James_ to both James and Blackmur scholars and to readers first encountering either writer. An historical introduction has been provided by editor Veronica A. Makowsky, who also edited Blackmur’s _Henry Adams_ (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1980).
