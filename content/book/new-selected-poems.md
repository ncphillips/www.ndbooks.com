_The New Selected Poems_ replaces the slim volume with which New Directions first introduced Stevie Smith (1902-1971) to American readers. Chronologically arranged, the book contains 165 poems along with many of her humorous drawings. Stevie Smith wrote poems about everything––hats, children, death, theology, marriage, political and social issues, suicide, nature, history, her own autobiography, friends, foes, and animals (especially cats)––and she wrote them in an inimitable way. She is delightfully deceitful: echoes from a wide range of poetic literature shimmer elusively; themes that at first seem simple, almost childlike, cut knife-edge deep to serious concerns; her metrics, her inner rhymes and assonances, her mischievous throw-away lines are sly in their subtle control; her humor––and certainly she is funny––is a coin with a dark side. “A more individual talent than Stevie Smith’s you don’t get," Clive James remarked recently in _The New Yorker_. "Stevie Smith was an artist of the utmost sophistication… She strove industriously to make it look as if she didn’t know what she was doing. She knew exactly… When she is in form she can deconstruct literature in the only way that counts––by constructing something that feels as if it has just flown together, except that you can’t take it apart."
