In this monumental collection, the inimitable Muriel Spark addresses all of her favorite subjects: the writing life; love; cats; favorite writers (T. S. Eliot, Robert Burns, the Brontës, Mary Shelley); Piero della Francesca; life in wartime London and in glamorous “Hollywood-on-the-Tiber” 1960s Rome; faith; and parties (of course). 

Spark’s scope is amazing, and her striking, glancing insights are precise and unforgettable. From the mysteries of Job’s sufferings, she glides to Dame Edith Sitwell’s cocktail-party advice on how to handle a nasty publisher, and on to the joys of success.
