Here in the authorized translation by James Graham-Lujan and Richard L. O’Connell, with an illuminating biographical introduction by the poet’s brother, Francisco García Lorca, are three tragic dramas by the great modern Spanish poet and playwright which have caught the imagination and won the critical acclaim of the literate world:

_Blood Wedding_: Concerned with love that cannot become marriage among the primitive hill people of Castile, this is a play of the workings of tremendous passions and tribal ritual toward an inescapable tragic end.

_Yerma_: According to Edwin Honig, author of a biography on Lorca, "The whole tragic burden of _Yerma_ is measured by the deepening of her struggle with the problem of frustrated motherhood."

_The House of Bernarda Alba_: Again about “women whom love moves to tragedy," Bernarda Alba tells of the repression of five daughters by a domineering mother, of how their natural spirits circumvented her but bring violence and death.
