In the seventy-three poems collected here Muriel Spark works in open forms as well as villanelles, rondels, epigrams, and even the tour de force of a twenty-one page ballad. She also shows herself a master of unforgettable short poems. Before attaining fame as a novelist (_Memento Mori_, _The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie_), Muriel Spark was already an acclaimed poet. The "power and control" of her poetry, as _Publishers Weekly_ remarked, "is almost startling." With the vitality and wit typical of all her work, Dame Muriel has never stopped writing poems, which frequently appear in _The New Yorker_. As with all her creations, the poems show Spark to be "astonishingly talented and truly inimitable" (_The San Francisco Chronicle_).
