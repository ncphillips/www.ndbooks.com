Long out of print and now reissued in paperback, _Cronopios and Famas_ is one of the best-loved books by perhaps the greatest of Latin American novelists (author of _Hopscotch_ and _Blow Up and Other Stories_). "The Instruction Manual," the first chapter, is an absurd assortment of tasks and items dissected in an instruction-manual format. "Unusual Occupations," the second chapter, describes the obsessions and predilections of the narrator’s family, including the lodging of a tiger — just one tiger — "for the sole purpose of seeing the mechanism at work in all its complexity." Finally, the "Cronopios and Famas" section delightfully presents, in the words of Carlos Fuentes, "those enemies of pomposity, academic rigor mortis and cardboard celebrity — a hand of literary Marx Brothers." As the _Saturday Review_ remarked: "Each page of _Cronopios and Famas_ sparkles with vivid satire that goes to the heart of human character and, in the best pieces, to the essence of the human condition.
