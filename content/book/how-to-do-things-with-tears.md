_How to Do Things with Tears_ is a book brought forth by the Sighted Singer, the poet who holds the central position in Allen Grossman’s newest work. "This is a HOW-TO book," Grossman explains. "The heroic singer of tradition is blind. A NEW singer in this present must be sighted. In this book the poet intends to say something, insofar as a poet can, about the common sadness of living and dying in the world." Like the blind bard of old, Grossman’s _Sighted Singer_ conjures visions both high and low, in mythopoeic resonances that excite the sorrows and the laughter of the gods and men.
