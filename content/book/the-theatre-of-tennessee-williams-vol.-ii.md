_The Theatre of Tennessee Williams_ brings together in a matching format the plays of a genius of the American theatre. Arranged in chronological order this ongoing series includes the original cast listings and production notes. _The Eccentricities of a Nightingale_, a play in three acts, was intended as an alternate to _Summer and Smoke_ (1948), but was never produced on Broadway. These two versions of the same play introduce _Volume 2_. They are followed by _The Rose Tattoo_ (1950), an exploration of love and death in a Sicilian fishing community on the American Gulf Coast, and _Camino Real_ (1953), a unique work of symbolism and fantasy that creates a mythic landscape of beauty and horror.
