Voted by _The New York Times_ as one of the greatest poems of the twentieth century, _Spring and All_ is a manifesto of the imagination – a hybrid of alternating sections of prose and free verse that crystalizes in dramatic, energetic, and beautifully cryptic statements of how language recreates the world. _Spring and All_ contains some of Williams’s best known poetry, including Section I, which opens, "By the road to the contagious hospital" (now commonly known by the title "Spring and All"), and Section XXII, where Williams penned his most famous poem, "The Red Wheelbarrow." Although _Spring and All_ has been always available in collected works such as _Imaginations_ and _Collected Poems: Volume I_, this stand-alone facsimile edition makes it shine as the individual book William Carlos Williams intended it to be.
