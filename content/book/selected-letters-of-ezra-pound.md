Ezra Pound would deserve a place in the literary history of the twentieth century if only for bringing to light and to publication the work, among others, of T. S. Eliot, Robert Frost, James Joyce and William Carlos Williams. His tireless activities in behalf of other poets, artists, and literary ventures of every sort were in large part carried on by way of his voluminous correspondence. Eliot himself once commented that Pound’s "epistolary style is masterly"––a judgment wholly confirmed by the 384 examples that comprise this selection. Included here are the poet’s letters to Margaret Anderson of _The Little Review_, Harriet Monroe of _Poetry_, Harriet Shaw Weaver of _The Egoist_, H. L. Mencken and John Quinn; to such poets and writers as E. E. Cummings, Ernest Hemingway, Amy Lowell, Marianne Moore, Eliot, Joyce and, of course, his old friend Dr. Williams. Of exceptional interest, however, is Pound’s massive correspondence with the young unknowns who wrote to him for advice. "The tone of his prose criticism," says D. D. Paige in his Introduction, "with its coruscations, its ellipses, its dogmatisms, its gay carnival air, its unwillingness to enjoy the safety gravity offers, its violence against entrenched stupidity and its championing of fresh writers––all that simply encouraged them to approach him. A tremendous lure!"
