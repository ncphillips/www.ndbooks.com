One of his most important and characteristic works, this new collection makes available two of Kenneth Patchen’s long out-of-print books: _Panels for the Walls of Heaven_ and _They Keep Riding Down All the Time_. Both were published in 1946; the first by Bern Porter in Berkeley, California, the second by Padell Publishers in New York. Also included are Patchen’s only short story, "Bury Them in Cod," from New Directions 1939, and a section from an early version of _Sleepers Awake_, “Angel-Carver Blues.” The rich variety of prose, poetry (concrete and otherwise), and illustrations establishes _In Quest of Candlelighters_ as one more reason why Patchen has been called "a one-man literary movement."
