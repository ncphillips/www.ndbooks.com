In the quiet suburbs, while Dorothy is doing chores and waiting for her husband to come home from work, not in the least anticipating romance, she hears a strange radio announcement about a monster who has just escaped from the Institute for Oceanographic Research...

Reviewers have compared Rachel Ingalls’ _Mrs. Caliban_ to _King Kong_, Edgar Allan Poe’s stories, the films of David Lynch, _Beauty and the Beast_, _The Wizard of Oz_, _E.T._, Richard Yates’s domestic realism, B-horror movies, and the fairy tales of Angela Carter—how such a short novel could contain all of these disparate elements is a testament to its startling and singular charm.
