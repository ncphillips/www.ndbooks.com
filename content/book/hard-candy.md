_Hard Candy_ contains Tennessee Williams’s short stories written after the publication of his first collection of short fiction, _One Arm_, and before the stories appearing in _The Knightly Quest_. These volumes have established him as an original, compelling, and honest master of the short story. The stories in _Hard Candy_ display Mr. Williams’s mastery of several very different styles. "Three Players of a Summer Game," for instance, is as powerful and moving a study of the disintegration of an individual as _A Streetcar Named Desire_. The delicate and luminous nostalgia of "The Resemblance Between a Violin Case and a Coffin" will remind readers of _The Glass Menagerie_. Other stories, like "Two on a Party," are more colloquial and brittle; and one––"The Coming of Something to the Widow Holly"––is an excursion into ironical fantasy. Yet each of the stories demonstrates, in its different way, the characteristic blend of psychological penetration with compassion and understanding that has marked Tennessee Williams’s successes in the theater.
