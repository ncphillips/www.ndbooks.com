In _Bending the Bow_, which presents his work in poetry since _Roots and Branches_, Robert Duncan is writing on a scale which places him among the poets, after Walt Whitman, bold enough to attempt the personal epic, the large-canvas rendering of man’s spirit in history as one man sees it, feels it, lives it, and makes it his own. In "Structures of Rime," the open series begun in _The Opening of the Field_ and continued in this volume, Duncan works with ideas, forces, and persons created in language itself––the life and identity of the poet in the poem. With the first thirty poems of "Passages," which form the structural base in _Bending the Bow_, he has begun a second open series––a multiphasic projection of movements in a field, an imagined universe of the poem that moves out to include all the terms of experience as meaning. Here Duncan draws upon and in turn contributes to a mode in American poetry where Pound’s _Cantos_, Williams’s _Paterson_, Zukofsky’s “_A_,” and Olson’s _Maximus Poems_ have led the way. The chronological composition of _Bending the Bow_ emphasizes Duncan’s belief that the significance of form is that of an event in process. Thus, the poems of the two open series belong ultimately to the configuration of a life in poetry in which there are forms moving within and interpenetrating forms. Versions of Verlaine’s _Saint Graal_ and _Parsifal_ and a translation of Gérard de Nerval’s _Les Chimères_ enter the picture; narrative bridges for the play _Adam’s Way_ have their place in the process; and three major individual poems––"My Mother Would Be a Falconress," "A Shrine to Ameinias," and "Epilogos"––among others make for an interplay of frames of reference and meaning in which even such resounding blasts of outrage at the War in Vietnam as "Up Rising" and "The Soldiers" are not for the poet things in themselves but happenings in a poetry that involve all other parts of his experience.
