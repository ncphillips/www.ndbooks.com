Just in time for his 98th birthday, New Directions is proud to present a swift, terrific chronological selection of Lawrence Ferlinghetti’s greatest poems. Through this tight lens, it is now possible to see Ferlinghetti—a brilliant and prolific poet—in a richer, broader, and more complex way. From his very first landmark books—_Pictures from the Gone World_ (City Lights, 1955) and _A Coney Island of the Mind_ (New Directions, 1958)—to new work, _Ferlinghetti’s Greatest Poems_ displays every stage of this multifaceted writer’s long and celebrated career. It’s exciting to revisit in one slender volume so much of the splendid, playful, and trenchant work of one of America’s greatest and most popular poets.
