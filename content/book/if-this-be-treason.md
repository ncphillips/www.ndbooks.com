Gregory Rabassa’s influence as a translator is tremendous. His translations of Gabriel García Márquez’s _One Hundred Years of Solitude_ and Julio Cortázar’s _Hopscotch_ have helped make these some of the the most widely read and respected works in world literature. (García Márquez was known to say that the English translation of _One Hundred Years_ was better than the Spanish original.) In If This Be Treason: Translation and Its Dyscontents, Rabassa offers a coolheaded and humorous defense of translation, laying out his views on the translator’s art. Anecdotal and always illuminating, Rabassa traces his career from a boyhood on a New Hampshire farm, his school days "collecting" languages, the two and a half years he spent overseas during WWII, and his South American travels, until one day "I signed a contract to do my first translation of a long work [Cortázar’s _Hopscotch_] for a commercial publisher." Additionally, Rabassa offers us his "rap sheet," a consideration of the various authors and the over 40 works he has translated. This longawaited memoir is a joy to read, an instrumental guide to translating, and a look at the life of one of its great practitioners.
