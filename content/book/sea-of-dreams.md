Gu Cheng (1956-1993) is one of China’s most celebrated contemporary poets. His early death ended a literary career that was influenced by the Cultural Revolution and that reawakened the lyricism of Chinese poets during the 1980s. Offering a unique blend of brooding imagism and political innuendo, Gu Cheng’s poetry traces complex changes in the poet’s life-familial, psychological, cultural––but also radiates innocence and a touching melancholy. His poetry began on the farms in Shandong province where his parents were exiled during the Cultural Revolution, and ended on a small island in New Zealand where he took up a Thoreau-like existence before his tragic suicide. His poem "One Generation" became emblematic for the generation coming of age during the ’60s and ’70s. Here for the first time is an edition based on the poet’s own personal selections from his work, and including the magnificent sequences of his middle career. Also incorporated are essays, letters, an interview, and excerpts from Gu Cheng’s novel _Ying’er_.
