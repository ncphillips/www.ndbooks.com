Karl Rossman, “a poor boy of seventeen,” has been sent away to America by his parents for his part in a scandal, and his travels unfold revelations about himself and his dreams. This is a new world where the Statue of Liberty holds aloft a sword rather than a torch, swindlers abound, and a bridge connects Boston to New York City.

_The San Francisco Chronicle_ said Hofmann’s “sleek translation does a wonderful job” and _The New York Times_ concurred: “Anything by Kafka is worth reading again, especially in the hands of such a gifted translator as Hofmann.”
