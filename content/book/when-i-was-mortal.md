Eavesdroppers, failed bodyguards, night doctors, forgers, liars, suicides, assassins, and ghosts populate the dozen stories of _When I Was Mortal_. "In the space of ten or twenty pages," as the _Nouvel Observateur_ remarked, "Marías contrives to write a novel." "The short story fits Marías like a glove," as _Le Point_ noted, and these stories have been acclaimed as "formidably intelligent" (_The London Review of Books_); and "startling" (_The New York Times Book Review_); "a refreshing discovery... [they] should be welcomed here like a bracing tonic" (_The Chicago Tribune_).
