On a small farm in Normandy, as Hitler rises to power in Germany, ten-year-old Ludo comes of age in the care of his Uncle Ambrose, an eccentric mailman and kite-maker. Ludo’s quiet existence changes the day he meets Lila, a girl from the aristocratic Polish family that owns the estate next door. In a single glance, Ludo falls in love forever; Lila, on the other hand, after eating the wild strawberries he offers her, disappears into the woods. Thus begins Ludo’s adventure of longing, passion, and steadfast love for the elusive Lila, who begins to reciprocate his feelings just as Europe descends into war. After Germany invades Poland, Lila disappears, and Ludo’s journey to save her from the Nazis becomes a journey to save his loved ones, his country, and ultimately himself. Filled with unforgettable characters who, as the war goes on, fling all they have into the fight to keep their hopes—and themselves—alive, _The Kites_ is Romain Gary’s poetic call for resistance in whatever form it takes. A war hero himself, Romain Gary embraced and fought for humanity in all its nuanced complexities, in the belief that a hero might be anyone who has the courage to love.
