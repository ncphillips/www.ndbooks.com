As Erik Anderson Reece says in _A Balance of Quinces_, “Many know Guy Davenport the creator of fiction, the critic, the illustrator, the poet, the translator.... But Guy Davenport the monastic painter is still unknown." Here gathered for the first time is a generous collection of Davenport’s paintings and drawings, interwoven with commentary by poet and critic Erik Anderson Reece. The broad scope of Davenport’s artistic output is included here: the pen-and-ink portraits, the abstract still lifes, and the collage compositions. Erik Anderson Reece’s essay provides cultural background for the work and examines it as am extension of Davenport’s writings. Besides the plentiful black-and-white reproductions throughout the text, this edition of _A Balance of Quinces_ also includes twenty-four pages of color plates.
