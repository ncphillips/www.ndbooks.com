Firmly rooted in place, John Allman’s moving and eloquent collection _Lowcountry_ is a hymn to nature, as experienced during his winter stayes in the rich and verdant Southern coastal region known as the Low Country, stretching from Charleston to Savannah. These poems celebrate the flora and fauna of that area, involving its art and history, as the poet also explores meanings that arise from his own past and present. _Lowcountry_ presents a surging array at once narrative and lyric—meditations on the heraldic great blue heron, a trio of works focused on the Civil War, dreams cast a prose poems, songs of married love, poems about his daughter’s pregnancy and the birth of her twin girls, as well as poems relating to the events of 9/11. The motifs of journey and return are everywhere in evidence.
