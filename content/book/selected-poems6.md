The French poet Saint-John Perse (1887-1975) succeeded, according to critic Roger Caillois, "in giving as a scene for his wholly spiritual chronicles a kind of supreme civilization, composed of the essence of those which history records and going beyond them in grandeur and majesty." In this bilingual edition of the _Selected Poems_, editor Mary Ann Caws has assembled extracts from all his major works––_Anabasis_, _Praises_, _Exile_, _Rains_, _Snows_, _Winds_, _Seamarks_, _Chronique_, _Birds_, and _Song for an Equinox_, in translations by T. S. Eliot, Louise Varse, Denis Devlin, Hugh Chisholm, Wallace Fowlie, Robert Fitzgerald, and Richard Howard.
