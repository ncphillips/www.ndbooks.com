In this collection New Directionsâ€”San Francisco Review presents an important discovery: William Bronk, a poet of great distinction, whose work until now has been seen chiefly in literary magazines. These poems have a blazing clarity. The flawless voice moves to the utmost intensity of emotion, an emotion deriving from the vigor of the thought. Once read, they cannot be dismissed from the mind.
