Widely held as one of the most profoundly influential of Latin-American writers, Nobel Prize winner Pablo Neruda regarded this collection, _Fully Empowered_, as a particular favorite. These poems, which came out of a most fruitful period of his life, claim a place in any selection of Neruda’s greatest work. "The People" (_El Pueblo_), about the state of the workingman in Chile’s past and present, is the most celebrated of his later poems. _Fully Empowered_ first appeared in Spanish in 1962 under the title of _Plenos Poderes_. It was translated into English by Alastair Reid at the specific request of the author and described by _The New Republic_ as "a full book, rich in experience, alternately groping and sweeping, and a joy to read."
