The speaker of _The Philosopher’s Window and Other Poems_, Allen Grossman tells us, is "an old man compelled by the insistent questioning of the children to explain himself"––and in this way, the world. He begins with creation ("The Great Work Farm Elegy"), recalls the romantic quest of youth ("The Philosopher’s Window"), returns to reality ("The Snowfall" and "Whoever Builds"). His tales told, the old man wakes in a stormy springtime ("June, June"), "when the lilacs are gone." Grossman’s allegory of life’s journey, at once sonorous and antic, takes in the high and the low in these new visionary songs of innocence and experience.
