_The Ghosts of Birds_ offers thirty-five essays by Eliot Weinberger: the first section of the book continues his linked serial-essay _An Elemental Thing_, which pulls the reader into “a vortex for the entire universe” (_Boston Review_). Here, Weinberger chronicles a nineteenth-century journey down the Colorado River, records the dreams of people named Chang, and shares other factually verifiable discoveries that seem too fabulous to possibly be true. The second section collects Weinberger’s essays on a wide range of subjects—some of which have been published in the _New York Review of Books_, and _London Review of Books_—including his notorious review of George W. Bush’s memoir, _Decision Points_, and writings about Khubilai Khan, the I Ching, different versions of the Buddha, American Indophilia (“There is a line, however jagged, from pseudo-Hinduism to Malcolm X”), Herbert Read, and Charles Reznikoff. This collection proves once again that Weinberger is “one of the bravest and sharpest minds in the United States” (Javier Marías).
