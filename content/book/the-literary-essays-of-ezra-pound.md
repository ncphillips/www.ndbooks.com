For this definitive collection of Pound’s _Literary Essays_, his friend (and English editor) T. S. Eliot chose material from five earlier volumes: _Pavannes and Divisions_ (1918), _Instigations_ (1920), _How to Read_ (1931), _Make It New_ (1934), and _Polite Essays_ (1937). 33 pieces are arranged in three groups: "The Art of Poetry," "The Tradition," and "Contemporaries." Eliot wrote in his introduction: "I hope that this volume will demonstrate that Pound’s literary criticism is the most important contemporary criticism of its kind . . perhaps the kind we can least afford to do without . . . the refreshment, the revitalization and ‘making new’ of literature in our time."
