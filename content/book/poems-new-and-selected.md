The poetry of the late James Laughlin (1914-97) spans a period of over sixty years, from the first verses written in his signature "typewriter" metric to the most recent pieces that open his _Poems New and Selected_. Laughlin reveals himself in his poems as a master of concision, of the well-placed word that penetrates the human heart. Over two hundred and twenty-five poems included here show his technical brilliance as well: in short- and long-line poems; in the three-stress verses of his autobiographical "Byways"; in "Epigrams," amatory and otherwise, and "Pentastichs"; in idiosyncratic "(American) French" poems and their translations of his own devising. For readers coming to Laughlin’s work for the first time, this collection will be a sea of undiscovered riches, and for longtime devotees, a chance to ply once again the well-chartered waters of his poetry.
