_How to Paint Sunlight_, now being made available in paperbook format, is graced with a short introduction by the poet in which he says, "All I ever wanted to do was paint light on the walls of life." For more than fifty years Ferlinghetti has been doing just that––illuminating both the everyday and the unusual, all the while keeping true to his original dictum of speaking in a way accessible to everyone. He has been, and remains, "one of our ageless radicals and true bards" (_Booklist_), and his voice is well known in many places around the world. He was one of the two American poets (the other being John Ashbery) chosen to participate in the second celebration of UNESCO’s World of Poetry Day in Delphi, Greece, where he along with his international confreres each poetically addressed the Oracle. His poem for the occasion is now included in this book.
