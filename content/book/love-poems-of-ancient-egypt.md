Ezra Poundâ€™s incomparable gifts as a translator delight us anew in _Conversations in Courtship_, an Egyptian love poem which he has put into English from the Italian versions of his son-in-law Boris de Rachewiltz, a distinguished Egyptologist. Illness having prevented Mr. Pound from continuing the work, the remaining poems of this remarkable collection, which is drawn from the hieroglyphics of papyri and pottery inscriptions, have been translated by the poet Noel Stock. The color, freshness and vitality of these ageless poems offer an enchanting revelation of life as it must have been in the Valley of the Nile more than three thousand years ago.
