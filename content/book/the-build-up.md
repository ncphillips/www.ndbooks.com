_The Build-up_, Volume 3 of the _Stecher Trilogy_, picks up the thread of _White Mule_ and _In the Money_. Although all of the novels deal with the triumphant rise of an immigrant family in the early 1900s, _the Build-up_ is more concerned with the overwhelming drive and ambition of Joe Stecher’s wife, Gurlie. After years of hard work, careful planning (and his wife’s badgering) Joe’s printing business is providing his family with a comfortable income. As soon as her financial goal is realized, Gurlie focuses her attention on another area. Her phenomenal energy is soon earning her all unassailable position as a social leader in a small New Jersey suburb. Her achievement is not without its heartache, however. This story is told with all the gentle humor and exacting detail that mark Williams’s prose works.
