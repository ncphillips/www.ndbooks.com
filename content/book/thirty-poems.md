**_A Christine Burgin co-publication_**

In a small, exquisite clothbound format resembling the early Swiss and German editions of Walser’s work, _Thirty Poems_ collects famed translator Christopher Middleton’s favorite poems from the more than five hundred Walser wrote. The illustrations range from an early poem in perfect copperplate handwriting, to one from a 1927 Czech-German newspaper, to a microscript.
