Even the _American Heritage Dictionary_ acknowledges that F. Scott Fitzgerald “epitomized the Jazz Age.” And nowhere among his writings are the gin, pith, and morning-after squint of that era better illuminated than in these short essays. Selected in celebration of the 100th anniversary of Fitzgerald’s birth, these candid personal memoirs––one written with his wife, Zelda––furnish nothing less than the autobiography of "the lost generation" of the 1920s. "He lacked armor," EL. Doctorow, author of _The Waterworks_, _Ragtime_, and _Billy Bathgates_, notes in his introduction. “He did not live in protective seclusion, as Faulkner. He was not carapaced in self-presentation, as Hemingway. He jumped right into the foolish heart of everything, as he had into the Plaza fountain." _The Jazz Age_ is a celebration of one of the twentieth century’s most vital writers.
