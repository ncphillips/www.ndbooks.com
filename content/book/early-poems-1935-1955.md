"The growth of the work of Octavio Paz," writes Muriel Rukeyser in her preface to this bilingual selection of the Mexican poet’s _Early Poems_, "has made clear to an audience in many languages what was evident from the beginning ... he is a great poet, a world-poet whom we need. The poems here speak––as does all his work since––deeply, erotically, with grave and passionate involvement." In this, a much revised edition of the earlier _Selected Poems_ (Indiana University Press, 1963), Miss Rukeyser has joined to her own translations those of Paul Blackburn, Lysander Kemp, Denise Levertov, and William Carlos Williams, while many of the readings embody Paz’s own revisions of the original texts. The poems were chosen from eight separate collections, among them _Condición de nube_ ("Phase of Cloud"), _Semillas para un himno_ ("Seeds for a Psalm"), _Piedras sueltas_ ("Riprap"), and _Estación violenta_ ("Violent Season").
