Kamau Brathwaiteâ€™s poetry offers stunning collages devoted to the history, mythology, and language of the African diaspora, and has gained him a world reputation. _Middle Passages_, his most recent collection, is his sixteenth poetry volume, but his first with an American publisher. With notes of protest and lament, the fourteen poems of _Middle Passages_ address the effects of the Middle Passage of slavery on the New World, and celebrate great musicians (Ellington, Bessie Smith), poets, heroes of the resistance, and Third World leaders Kwame Nkrumah, Walter Rodney, and Nelson Mandela. And as the _London Times Literary Supplement_ noted, it is "a poetry that moves between rage and tenderness, doubt and displacement to affirmation... Middle Passages is a potent and effective book, a work of passion and integrity."
