The British poet Stevie Smith, as her many readers well know, sprinkled her drawings throughout her poetry collections. In this sketchbook, _Some Are More Human Than Others_, she did the opposite––she spiced her drawings with words. Together they resound with what Robert Lowell described as Smith’s "unique and cheerfully gruesome voice" and open up a little world of peculiar experience: something somber and something gay, innocent and cruel––truths of our world trapped off guard.
