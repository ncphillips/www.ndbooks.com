In the sixty poems that comprise _The Freeing of the Dust_, Denise Levertov continues to explore the personal and public themes that have threaded through her work in the past several years. The disastrous American involvement in Indochina, relations with family and close friends, are depicted with unique poignancy as she pits the at times terrifying concrete image against her vision of the ideal. Here we have poems that speak out of the direct tragedy of war, the result of Ms. Levertov’s visit to North Vietnam in the fall of 1972, while others reflect the anguish and the exultation of what she has called the “inner/outer experience in America during the 60s and the beginning of the 70s…” The Freeing of the Dust is the tenth book of verse by the woman Kenneth Rexroth has named “the most subtly skillful poet of her generation, the most profound, the most modest, the most moving.”
