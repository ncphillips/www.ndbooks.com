Denise Levertov is surely one of the most impressive of the younger poets writing in English today. Her earlier books (_Here and Now_, _Overland to the Islands_, _With Eyes at the Back of Our Heads_) were notable on several counts: technically, for her fine ear and her skill with free but controlled forms; in their substance, for the intensity––and clarity––of her very personal vision. These qualities persist in _The Jacob’s Ladder_, and to them has been added––particularly in the powerful sequence on themes suggested by the Eichmann trial––a larger social concern, a more penetrating identification with the great problems of humanity. In addition, thirteen poems from the now out-of-print earlier volume _Overland to the Islands_ are included by courtesy of Jonathan Williams, the original publisher.
