_The Red Noteboo_k stories, pulled from Auster’s own life or from the lives of those close to him, are explorations of unexpected coincidences. A wrong number becomes the genesis for a famous novel; a hero appears at an inopportune moment; a lightning storm harries a group of campers; a daughter plunges from a terrifying height only to land improbably safely; a Paul Auster imposter materializes. Like a magic show, _The Red Notebook_ demonstrates that “there is much to life that is special and serendipitous — if only we allow ourselves to perceive it this way” (_The Washington Post_).
