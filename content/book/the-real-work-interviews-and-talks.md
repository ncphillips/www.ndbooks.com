_The Real Work_ is the second volume of Gary Snyder’s prose to be published by New Directions. Where his earlier _Earth House Hold_ (1969) heralded the tribalism of the "coming revolution," the interviews in _The Real Work_ focus on the living out of that process in a particular place and time––the Sierra Nevada foothills of Northern California in the 1970s. The talks and interviews collected here range over fifteen years (1964-79) and encompass styles as different as those of the _Berkeley Barb_ and _The New York Quarterly_. A "poetics of process" characterizes these exchanges, but in the words of editor Mclean, their chief attraction is "good, plain talk with a man who has a lively and very subtle mind and a wide range of experience and knowledge."
