The devil in Henry Miller’s Big Sur paradise is Conrad Moricand: "A friend of his Paris days, who, having been financed and brought over from Europe as an act of mercy by Mr. Miller, turns out as exacting, sponging, evil, cunning, and ungrateful a guest as can be found in contemporary literature. Mr. Miller has always been a remarkable creator of character. Conrad Moricand is probably his masterpiece..._A Devil in Paradise_ is the work of a great novelist manqué, a novelist who has no stricter sense of form than the divine creator...Fresh and intoxicating, funny and moving..." –_TLS_
