In 1982 William Bronk won the American Book Award for his book _Life Supports: New & Collected Poems_. Since then, he has written seven additional books, and _Sagetrieb_ has devoted an entire issue to his work. Bronk is unquestionably a major poet––utterly original, uncompromisingly abstract in content, and deeply sensuous in form. Michael Heller, in _The New York Times Book Review_, said Bronk’s poetry is "singularly persistent in its own investigation of how our deepest truths are those which are most unsayable." This volume spans Bronk’s entire career, from his first book _Light and Dark_, to his most recent _Some Words and The Mild Day_ (Talisman), which the _Village Voice_ praised as "offering epigrammatic style, philosophical reverie, and haiku-like concision." _Selected Poems_ is an indispensible collection, containing the most compelling and the most popular of Bronk’s eloquent poems.
