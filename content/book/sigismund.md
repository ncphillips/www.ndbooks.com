To readers familiar with Lars Gustafsson’s work, the playful philosophizing of _Sigsmund_ will come as no surprise, as he leisurely pulls together seeming fragments into a narrative of 1970s Berlin that at once looks back to Homer, Dante, and the Faust legend and ahead to space warfare and intergalactic travel, childhood memories of Sweden, Marxist-Leninism, sports competition, art, epistemology, daydreams––nothing is excluded from the purview of Gustafsson’s lighthearted humanism. And behind it all broods the restless spirit of the author’s alter ego, the warring king, Sigismund III of Poland (d. 1632).
