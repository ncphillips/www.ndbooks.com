_Viper Rum_ is Mary Karr’s first book since _The Liars’ Club_, which helped to spark a renaissance in memoir. That breathtaking bestseller about her Texas childhood rode _The New York Times_ bestseller list for more than sixty weeks. It was hailed by _The Washington Post_ as "the essential American story, a beauty." Critic James Atlas likened her to Faulkner. Molly Ivins remarked in _The Nation_, "[_The Liars’ Club_] is so good I thought about sending it out for a second opinion... To have a poet’s precision of language and a poet’s insight into people applied to one of the roughest, toughest, ugliest places in America is an astonishing gift." Now that gift returns to its origins in poetry. _Viper Rum_ delves into the autobiographical subject matter of her two earlier collections (_The Devil’s Tour_, New Directions, 1994 and Abacus, Wesleyan, 1987). Various beloveds are birthed and buried in these touching lyrics, some of which––as the title suggests––deal with drink: "I cast back to those last years/ I drank, alone nights at the kitchen sink,/ bathrobed, my head hatching snakes,/ while my baby slept in his upstairs cage/ and my marriage choked to death..." Precise and surprising, her poems "take on the bedevilments of fate and grief with a diabolical edge of their own" (_Poetry_). The prize-winning essay "Against Decoration," which first set off a controversy in _Parnassus_, serves as an Afterword. In it, Karr attacks the popular trend toward ornament in contemporary poetry: "the highbrow doily-making that passes for art today."
