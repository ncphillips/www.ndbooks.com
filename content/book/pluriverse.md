_Pluriverse: New and Selected Poems_ charts the life-work of the celebrated poet Ernesto Cardenal—“one of the world’s major poets” (_Choice_) and “the preeminent poet of Central America today” (_Library Journal_). Follow Cardenal’s poetic development across six decades, from the early exteriorismo poems and romantic epigrams of the early 1950s, to the increasingly spiritual and political verse he wrote as priest and activist (including his classic revolutionary documentary poem “Zero Hour”) to the shorter victory and ecology poems, and elegies to fallen Sandinistas, and on to the cosmic-mystical-scientific dimensions of his later work. “Here they are—" editor Jonathan Cohen writes in his Introduction, “to gladden your heart and enrich your soul.”
