Here is the complete music-filled arc of Louis Zukofsky’s shorter verse collected in one volume: lyrical love poems written to his wife Celia and son Paul; the groundbreaking "Poem Beginning ’The’," which sends up ’The Waste Land’ and its cultural vision in a cloud of bricolage, a hilarious pastiche of quotes, canon and kitsch, high and low hopelessly intertwined" (Michael Palmer); the boisterous, riotous translations of Catallus; spare, brilliant nature poems as if written by an ancient hokku master; his genius "’Mantis’" sestina; the enigmatic, spiraling, and beautiful last poems, "80 Flowers." _Anew: Complete Shorter Poetry_ is a book of blessings and gifts for any poetry lover.
