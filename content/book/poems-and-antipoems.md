The Chilean poet Nicanor Parra is one of those significant figures who appear from time to time in all literatures and through a profound originality and sense of the Pound/Confucius principle of "Make It New" revitalize the poetry of their language. Just as the Imagists and William Carlos Williams rechannelled the course of American poetry, so Parra’s "antipoems," with their directness of metaphor and rejection of rhetoric and "poetic" decoration, are influencing young poets throughout Latin America. "Antipoetry," Parra has said, "seeks to return poetry to its roots." The reader may judge from this collection, which is drawn from all of Parra’s published books, how well he has succeeded. Poems and Antipoems has been edited, with an introduction, by Miller Williams and presents Parra’s Spanish texts opposite the English versions which are by the editor, W. S. Merwin, Denise Levertov, Thomas Merton, William Carlos Williams, Allen Ginsberg, Fernando Alegria, J. Laughlin, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, who first discovered Parra for North American readers with a book in the City Lights series in 1960.
