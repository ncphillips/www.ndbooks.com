Federico García Lorca is admired the world over for the lyricism, immediacy, and beauty of his poetry. The superb translators of this collection — Stephen Spender, Langston Hughes, Ben Belitt, William Jay Smith, and W. S. Merwin — have produced English versions that catch the spirit and intensity of the originals. Presented bilingually, this is a selection of Lorca’s very best.
