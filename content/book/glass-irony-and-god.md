Anne Carson’s poetry––characterized by various reviewers as "short talks," "essays," or "verse narratives"––combines the confessional and the critical in a voice all her own. Known as a remarkable classicist, Anne Carson in _Glass, Irony and God_ weaves contemporary and ancient poetic strands with stunning style. This collection includes "The Glass Essay," a powerful poem about the end of a love affair, told in the context of Carson’s reading of the Brontë sisters, "Book of Isaiah," which evokes the deeply primitive feel of ancient Judaism, and "The Fall of Rome," about her trip to "find" Rome and her struggle to overcome feelings of terrible alienation there.
