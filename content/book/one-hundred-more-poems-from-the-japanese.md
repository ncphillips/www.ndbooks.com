Kenneth Rexroth’s _One Hundred Poems from the Japanese_ (1955) proved such an extremely popular book that he put together a sequel. The poems are representative of a large range of classical, medieval, and modern poetry, but the emphasis, as in his companion Chinese collections (1955 and 1970), is on folk songs and love lyrics. And because women have had such an outstanding role in Japanese literature, included here are selections from the work, among others, of the remarkable early twentieth-century poet Yosano Akiko and the more contemporary, deeply sensuous Marichiko. As in the earlier volume, _One Hundred More Poems from the Japanese_ presents the original texts in romaji, the transliteration into the Western alphabet, while the authors’ names are given in traditional calligraphy.
