In _Love Is Like Park Avenue_, Alvin Levin reveals that part of New York society that lived in the Bronx but longed to be in the shadow of skyscrapers — with the dance bands, celebrities, and socialites; his characters create a mirror world of love and sex. This fascinating compendium of Levin’s writings offers a look at the career of an “outsider artist” who was never able to finish a long novel, yet whose fragments are of heartbreaking intensity and amazing social scope. Edited by James Reidel (the biographer of the vanished poet Weldon Kees), _Love Is Like Park Avenue_ contains stories, an unfinished novel, and sketches, all of which either appeared in premier literary magazines, with avant-garde small presses, or were discovered unpublished in boxes. Also contained is correspondence with encouraging publishers, offering the portrait of a brilliant writer who never quite found success despite publication in some of the era’s most prestigious magazines. Levin wrote these unforgettable fictional accounts of life in Depression-era New York, capturing the rhythms and tone of his time with intensity, wit, and probing genius.
