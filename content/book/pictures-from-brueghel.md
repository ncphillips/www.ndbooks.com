This collection makes available work of one of our greatest American poets in the last decade of his life. The first section, _Pictures from Brueghel_, contains previously uncollected short poems, while the second and third parts are the complete texts of _The Desert Music_ (1954) and _Journey to Love_ (1955), originally published by Random House. In these books, Dr. Williams perfected his "variable foot" metric and achieved full mastery of the "American idiom" which was his lifelong first concern. Among the poems of this period is the long "Asphodel, That Greeny Flower" which W. H. Auden has called "one of the most beautiful love poems in the language." _Pictures from Brueghel_ was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry only two months after William Carlos Williamsâ€™ death on March 4, 1963.
