Antonio Tabucchi describes his novella _Indian Nocturne_ (winner of the Médicis Prize in its French translation) as "an insomnia" but also a journey... in which a Shadow is sought." In his provocatively elusive but totally compelling way, Tabucchi takes us along on a nightmarish trip through the Indian subcontinent, producing sensations by turns exotic, sensual, menacing, and oppressive, as the profound weight of an ancient culture settles on the unwary traveler. A doctor warns the nameless narrator: "A lot of people lose their way in India... it’s a country specially made for that." At the end of the journey, it’s for the reader to decide if the narrator did in fact lose his way — or perhaps find it. Tabucchi’s stories, published by New Directions in two earlier collections, _Letter from Casablanca_ and _Little Misunderstandings of No Importance_, have been called "triumphs of nuance and suggestion" (_Chicago Tribune_) and praised as "meticulously crafted... marked by wit, emotion, memory, and lost grandeur" (_Publishers Weekly_).
