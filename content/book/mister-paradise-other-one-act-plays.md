This collection of previously unpublished one-acts includes some of Tennessee Williams’s most poignant and hilarious characters: the tough and outrageous drag queens of _And Tell Sad Stories of the Deaths of Queens..._; the betrayed wife who refuses to take a lover in _The Fat Man’s Wife_; and the extravagant mistress who cheats on her married man in _The Pink Bedroom_.

Most of these plays were written in the 1930s and early 1940s, when Williams was already flexing his formindable theatrical imaginations: lovers scramble for quick assignations in the closed movie theater balcony of _These Are the Stairs You’ve Got to Watch_; Chekovian-style family ennui in _Summer at the Lake_ leads to heartbreak; and in _Thank You, Kind Spirit_ a mulatto spiritualist from New Orleans’ French Quarter is visciously exposed as a fraud – or is she?

Acclaimed stage and film actors Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson have conitrbuted a delightful foreword based on their memories of working with the playright, while an insightful introduction and notes  by editors Nicholas Moschovakis and David Rossel provide biographical and textual background.
