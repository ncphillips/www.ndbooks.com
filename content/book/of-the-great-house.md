"A book of poems should have exactly the same fullness and risk and lay itself open to the same judgment as a life," says Allen Grossman. _Of the Great House_, which includes sections of _A Harlot’s Hire_ (1961), Grossman’s first published book, as well as his most recent poetry, presents an anatomy of the poet’s working life. The title poem invokes "the sighted singer, in a/Passionate, laboring house," who confronts those figures in his unconscious which influence and interfere with poetic vision, braving the necessary destructions until "there is nothing in place of what/I know, the only thing that is––the world." Part II, "The Pictures in a Man’s Life," seeks out relationships among the haunting, inspiring, "demonically incoherent facts of life in the world––the poet’s parents, yellowwoods blooming on a lawn, closeness to an earlier self. "The Dream Which Wakes the Sleeper Does Not End" contains poems from an earlier life, and _Of the Great House_ closes with "An Inventory of Destructions," a summing and a summoning: "the poet speaks to the unborn in the/language of the born, and to the born he speaks/The language of the unborn––Break down and build!/Destructions are of the poet. Death is of God.”
