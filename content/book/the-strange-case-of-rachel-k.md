The three pieces gathered in _The Strange Case of Rachel K_ roughly map the genesis of Rachel Kushner’s fiction. From the fate of a conquistador in “The Great Exception,” to the illegal radio broadcasts and then bombs in “Debouchment,” to a Havana courtesan’s “strange” case, these stories build into a vision of Cuba that is black-humored, brutal, and beautiful.

In this collection, which “overflows in atmosphere as it shows off the burgeoning talent of one of our best writers” (NPR), Rachel Kushner is forging her own original path into the wilds of contemporary fiction.
