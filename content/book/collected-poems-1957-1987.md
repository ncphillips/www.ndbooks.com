Nobel Laureate Octavio Paz is incontestably Latin America’s foremost living poet. _The Collected Poems of Octavio Paz_ is a landmark bilingual gathering of all the poetry he has published in book form since 1957, the year of his premier long poem_, Sunstone (Piedra de Sol)–_–here translated anew by Eliot Weinberger––made its appearance. This is followed by the complete texts of _Days and Occasions_ (_Días Hábiles_), _Homage and Desecrations_ (_Homenaje y Profanaciones_), _Salamander_ (_Salamandra_), _Solo for Two Voices_ (_Solo a Dos Voces_), _East Slope_ (_Ladera Este_), _Toward the Beginning_ (_Hacia el Comienzo_), _Blanco_, _Topoems_ (_Topoemas_), _Return_ (_Vuelta_), _A Draft of Shadows_ (_Pasado en Claro_), _Airborn_ (_Hijos del Aire_), and Paz’s most recent collection, _A Tree Within_ (_Arbol Adentro_).
