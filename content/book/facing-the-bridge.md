When he watched Michael Jackson’s videos, every cell in Tamao’s body started to seethe: he even felt his appearance begin to change. His friends all said plastic surgery was in bad taste. But didn’t everyone harbor a secret desire for a new face? His own was as plain as a burlap sack, so he put it out of his mind and studied hard to compensate for how dull he looked. He told himself that fretting over one’s appearance was a job for women. But deep down, doesn’t every man who lacks confidence in his looks yearn for that moment when the Beast turns into a handsome young man? -- from _Facing the Bridge_ reading Yoko Tawada becomes an obsession, like watching the films of Catherine Deneuve. In _Facing the Bridge_, Tawada’s second story collection with New Directions, obsession becomes delight as the reader is absorbed into three tales where identities flicker and shift within borders as wide as the mind.
