First published in 1915, _Cathay_, Ezra Pound's early monumental work, originally contained fourteen translations from the Chinese and a translation of the Anglo-Saxon poem "The Seafarer." In 1916, _Cathay_ was reprinted in Pound's book _Lustra_ without "The Seafarer" and with four more Chinese poems.

_Cathay_ was greatly indebted to the notes of Ernest Fenollosa, a Harvard-trained scholar. "In Fenollosa's Chinese poetry materials," the noted scholar Zhaoming Qian writes, "Pound discovered a new model that at once mirrored and challenged his developing poetics." This centennial edition reproduces the text of the original publication along with the added poems from _Lustra_ and transcripts of the relevant Fenollosa notes and Chinese texts. Also included is a new foreword by Ezra Pound's daughter Mary de Rachewitz, rich with fascinating background material on this essential work of Pound's oeuvre.
