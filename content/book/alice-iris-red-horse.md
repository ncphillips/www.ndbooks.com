Yoshimasu Gozo is one of the most prominent figures in contemporary Japanese literature and art. His creative endeavors have spanned over half a century since the publication of his first book of poetry, _Shuppatsu (Departure)_. Much of his work is so unorthodox it defies the print medium. Since the late sixties, Gozo has collaborated with visual artists and free-jazz musicians. In the late eighties, he began creating art objects that featured words engraved on copper plates and later produced photographs and video works. In _Alice Iris Red Horse_, the poet Forrest Gander has gathered translations of Gozo’s major works that represent his entire career. Also included here are illuminating interviews and reproductions of Gozo’s artworks and performances.
