When the poet Kenneth Rexroth died in 1982, he left behind a sequel to _An Autobiographical Novel_ (1966). His published memoir––all 365 pages of it––stopped at 1927, when the twenty-two-year-old writer and his first wife, Andrée, were about to settle in California. Now revised and expanded, _An Autobiographical Novel_ includes reminiscences that cover another twenty years of literary life and two more marriages. Linda Hamalian, author of _A Life of Kenneth Rexroth_ (W. W. Norton, 1991), sifted through more than 300 pages of raw tape transcriptions. Weighing fact against fictions (Rexroth loved a tall tale and relished gossip), Hamalian has prepared a valuable index that identifies obscure allusions and the real people who figured in Rexroth’s emotionally tumultuous life. "It adds up to a very good read," she says. "I am willing to bet a nice chunk of money that readers will wish Rexroth had been able to go on and on loosening his talk-tapes."
