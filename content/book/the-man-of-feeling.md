Narrated by a young opera star, _The Man of Feeling_ opens as he recalls traveling on a train from Milan to Venice, silently absorbed for hours by the woman asleep opposite his seat. In the measured tones of memory, the novel revolves on the twin poles of anticipation and recollection. Our protagonist’s peculiar rarified life -- a life of rehearsal and performance and luxury hotels and constant travel -- and his resulting almost ghost-like detachment adds a deeper tone to Marías’s weave of desire and distance. As the author remarks in a brief afterword, this is a love story "in which love is neither seen nor experienced, but announced and remembered." Can love be recalled truly when it no longer exists? That twist will continue to revolve in the reader’s mind, conjuring up in its disembodied way James’ _The Turn of the Screw_. Beautifully translated by Margaret Jull Costa, this fascinating and eerie early novel by Javier Marías bears out his reputation for being "a true genius of literary subterfuge" (_Village Voice_) and "dazzling" (_TLS_). "There is nothing," _The New York Times_ commented about _The Man of Feeling_, "quite like it in fiction today."
