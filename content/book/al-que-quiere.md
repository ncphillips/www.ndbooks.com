Published in 1917 by Four Seas Press, _Al Que Quiere!_ was William Carlos Williams’s third poetry book—his breakthrough volume—and contains some of his best-loved poems (“Tract,” “Apology,” “El Hombre,” “Danse Russe,” “January Morning,” and “Smell!”), as well as a Whitmanesque concluding long poem, “The Wanderer,” that anticipates his epic masterpiece _Paterson_. _Al Que Quiere!_ is the culmination of an experimental period for Williams that included his translations from Spanish. The Spanish epigraph of _Al Que Quiere!_ is from the short story “El hombre que parecía un caballo” (“The Man Who Resembled a Horse”) by the Guatemalan author Rafael Arévalo Martínez. This centennial edition contains Williams’s translation of the story (made with the help of his father), as well as a fascinating chapter from a book of conversations with Williams, _I Wanted to Write a Poem_, in which he comments on the individual poems.
