In his introduction, Rexroth tells us how Reverdy worked "with dismembered propositions from which subject, operator and object have been wretched free and restructures into an invisible or subliminal discourse which owes its cogency to its own strict, complex and secret logic. Poetry such as this attempts not just a new syntax of the word. Its restructuring of experience is purposive, not dreamilke [aswith the surrealists]. Its revolution is aimed at the syntax of the mind itself."
