"This book was first published October 15, 1934...," William Saroyan wrote of _The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze_. "You will have to take my word for it that I believed the world would never be the same." Certainly, it never was. Saroyanâ€™s debut collection of stories made a tremendous splash in the literary world, adding an author in love with his own madcap sincerity to a pantheon full of serious-minded modernists. "A novel is a novelist," he wrote, "and a short story is a short story writer." Saroyan, who won (and then refused) the Pulitzer Prize for his play _The Time of Your Life_, always wrote about humanity, and always on a human scale. He was also one of the first American writers of this century to focus so much attention on immigrant communities. The protagonists sailing about _The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze_ are often Armenian, Jewish, Chinese, Polish, African, or Irish; and all are treated with what _The San Francisco Chronicle_ called "the old Saroyan luminousness, which is to say with an insight as fresh as that of an unusually perceptive child."
