Michael Palmer has been acclaimed "exemplarily radical" (John Ashbery) and "one of America’s most important poets... startlingly lyrical and visceral" (_The Harvard Review_). His new book, _Company of Moths_––a collection in four parts, "Stone," "Scale," "Company of Moths," and "Dream"––is beautiful and fierce: "bright archive, sad merriment," "question pursuing question." Palmer in our dark times asks, "How will you now read in the dark?" Winner of the Shelley Memorial Prize and translated into over twenty-five languages, Michael Palmer was born in New York City in 1943 and lives in San Francisco, California.
