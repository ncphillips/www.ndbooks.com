Translations of substantial works by three important European poets--Erik Lindegren (Sweden), Cesare Pavese (Italy) and Roberto Sanesi (Italy)--are among the highlights of this 1969 New Directions Annual.

Also, there appear works by other well known poets such as William Bronk, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Anselm Hollo (England), W. S. Merwin, Edouard Roditi, and Mark Strand.

Emmett Jarrett, whose long poem, _Design for the City of Man: A Vision_, is an exciting discovery.

The prose section includes Thomas Merton’s satire on Negro segregation, _Plessy vs. Ferguson: Theme and Variations_, and a group of stories by Sanford Chernoff, Marvin Cohen, James B. Hall, James Purdy, Mia Raffel and Margaret Randall, which illustrate the rich diversity, both in technique and subject matter, of the short story form from the late sixties. There is also, in translation from the Flemish, the work of an important but too-little-known precursor of the modern movement, Paul van Ostaijen’s _Ika Loch’s Brothel_.
