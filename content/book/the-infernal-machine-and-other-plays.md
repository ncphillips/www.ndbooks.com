Among the great figures who pioneered the modern movement in world literature, none showed himself more versatile than France’s Jean Cocteau. Poet, novelist, critic, artist, actor, film-maker, Cocteau was also one of the greatest dramatists Europe has produced, with over a dozen plays which are frequently revived, not only in France, but in translation in many other countries. For this collection, fine translations of four full-length plays, one short play, and the “Speaker’s Text" for the Cocteau-Stravinsky opera _Oedipus Rex_ have been selected. The longer plays (_The Infernal Machine_, _Orpheus_, Bacchus, _Knights of the Round Table_) are re-creations of classic myth and legend—poetic and highly original interpretations of certain timeless themes which have inspired great drama through the ages. _The Eiffel Tower Wedding Party_ is, by contrast, merely a "curtain-raiser," but remarkable as un jeu d’esprit, revealing the wit and psychological penetration for which Cocteau is famous.
