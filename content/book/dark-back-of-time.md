Called by its author a “false novel,” _Dark Back of Time_ begins with the tale of the odd effects of publishing _All Souls_, his witty and sardonic 1989 Oxford novel. _All Souls_ is a book Marias swears to be fiction, but which its "characters"––the real-life dons and professors and bookshop owners who have "recognized themselves––fiercely maintain to be a roman á clef. With the sleepy world of Oxford set into fretful motion by a world that never "existed," Marías further stirs things up by weaving together autobiography (the brother who died as a child; the loss of his mother), a legendary kingdom, strange ghostly literary figures, maps and photographs, halls of mirrors, a one-eyed pilot, a bullet lost in Mexico, and a curse in Havana. Dark Back of Time has been acclaimed here as "superb" (_Review of Contemporary Fiction_), "fantastically original" (_Talk_), "brilliant" (_Virginia Quarterly Review_), and "a rare gift" (_The New York Times Book Review_). "In the best manner of Borges," _The Hudson Review_ commented, this hybrid is "lush and mysterious." Javier Marias, translated into thirty-four languages, has sold over four million copies of his books worldwide, and won a dazzling array of awards.
