With unnerving insistence _A Heart So White_ chronicles the relentless power of the past. Juan knows little of the interior life of his father Ranz; but when Juan marries, he considers the past anew, and begins to ponder what he doesn’t really want to know. Secrecy, its possible convenience, its price, and even its civility permeates the novel. _A Heart So White_ becomes a sort of anti-detective story of human nature. Intrigue; the sins of the father; the fraudulent and the genuine; marriage and strange repetitions of violence: Marías elegantly sends shafts of inquisitory light into shadows––and reckons the costs of ambivalence. ("My hands are of your colour; but I shame/To wear a heart so white" – Macbeth.) Called "dazzling" by _The London Times Literary Supplement_ and "a landmark by a genuine artist" by _Le Monde_, _A Heart So White_ won the Dublin IMPAC Prize and was rated by _El País_ as "his best and most ambitious novel."
