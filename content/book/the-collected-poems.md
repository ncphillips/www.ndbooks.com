At last, a complete, clear, and unobstructed view of Denise Levertov. Covering more than six decades and including, chronologically, every poem she ever published, Levertov's _Collected Poems_ presents her marvelous, groundbreaking work in full.

Born in England, Denise Levertov emigrated in 1948 to the United States, where she was acclaimed by Kenneth Rexroth in the _New York Times_ as “the most subtly skillful poet of her generation, the most profound, the most modest, the most moving." A staunch antiwar activist and environmentalist, fervently spiritual, and the winner of the Robert Frost Medal, the Shelley Memorial Award, and the Lannan Prize, Denise Levertov inspired generations of writers.
