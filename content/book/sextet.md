Resembling a musical sextet where no two instruments are the same, but all instruments blend to form a single sound, Henry Miller’s _Sextet_ combines six fresh and impromptu pieces of writing originally published as individual chapbooks by Capra Press: “On Turning Eighty,” “Reflections on the Death of Mishima,” “First Impressions of Greece,” “The Waters Reglitterized: The Subject of Water Colors in Some of its More Liquid Phases,” “Reflections on The Maurizius Case: A Humble Appraisal of a Great Book,” and “Mother, China and the World Beyond: A Dream in Which I Die and Find Myself in Devachan (Limbo) Where I Run into My Mother whom I Hated All My Life.” Like your favorite band releasing a six-song EP to keep you salivating until its next full-length album, _Sextet_ is a finger-snapping sample of Miller’s clarion-call work, with lots of raucous humor and jazz.
