Gondwana: an ancient supercontinent long dispersed into fragments in the Southern Hemisphere. The various parts of _Gondwana_ contemplate this once-massive continent at the end of the world and cohere into a unified whole that celebrates bird flight, waves, the blue ice of Antarctica, and innervating light while warning against environmental calamity. In the final long section, “Exitus Generis Humani,” lines pour over the reader in slow, mournful, yet often humorous song, as the human race ends and whole armies sink into the earth “yearning for mother love.” Nathaniel Tarn lifts up a mind-heart mirror of our contemporary existence in _Gondwana_ and warns us of a definitive ending if we do not demand radical change.
