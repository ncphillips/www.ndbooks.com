The publication in 1972 of _Invisibility Is the Art of Survival_, the authorâ€™s own selection of poems from earlier books brought out in England, introduced Edwin Brock to American readers. This new collection, _The Portraits & The Poses_, will further the acquaintance with a fresh and forceful voice, one which David Ignatow has called "the best in English contemporary poetry." These are highly personal poems: the "poses," the postures and bafflements of everyday life as Brock sees it; the "portraits," pithy vignettes of everyday people and their relationships as he knows them. Yet what is personal to the poet is made highly accessible by his art, and by his particular qualities of profound earthiness, honesty, humor, and concern.
