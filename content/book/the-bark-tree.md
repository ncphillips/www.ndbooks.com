Hailed by Robbe-Grillet as a new-wave novel twenty years ahead of its time, The Bark Tree ("Le Chiendent"), by the author of Zazie dans le Metro, first appeared in 1933. Queneau’s world, one of his characters explains, "doesn’t have the meaning it attributes to itself." Instead, it threatens constantly to annul existence, isolating each event so that neither love nor suffering can be felt. Struggling with this Cartesian uncertainty, Pierre attempts to manipulate human destiny for his own amusement. Alternately, Etienne manages to go from silhouette to substance by acknowledging the absurd discontinuity of objects that make up the here and now. Around these two swarm a diverse group of characters, headed by a scheming old woman, who pursue and are affected by a nonexistent fortune. Their adventures, often indistinguishably shifting from reality to imagination, challenge with sympathy and intelligence the desperate, funny dilemma of being and humanity in a world of accident. Queneau, hovering somewhere between author and character, discovers his language as he creates it. Abrupt time shifts, puns, phonetic spelling, popular speech rhythms, deliberately incorrect grammar, all provide a guise of comic incongruity that engages the aimlessness of human experience with an almost mathematical complexity of design. The Bark Tree is truly one of the bench marks in the development and structure of modern fiction.
