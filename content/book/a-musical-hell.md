“An aura of legendary prestige surrounds the work of Alejandra Pizarnik,” writes César Aira. Her last collection to be published before her suicide in 1972, _A Musical Hell_ is the first book of poems by Pizarnik to be published in its entirety in the U.S. Pizarnik writes at the edge of poetic impossibility, opening with a blues singer, expanding into silence, and closing into a theater of shadows and songs of the drowned.

> tell me what you see: inconclusive gestures, illusory objects, failed shapes.… Go
> to the window as if you’d been preparing for this your entire life.
