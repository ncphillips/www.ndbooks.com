_A Far Rockaway of the Heart_ is Ferlinghetti’s sequel to _Coney Island of the Mind_, written forty years afterwards in what the author has called "a poetry seizure" that lasted more than a year. A sequence of one hundred and one poems with recurrent themes, it includes various sections on love, art, music, history, and literature, as well as confrontations with major figures in the avant-garde before the arrival of the Beat generation. This paperbound edition now includes eighteen new poems from Ferlinghetti’s _Pictures of the Gone World_ which he publishes under his City Lights imprint. A self-styled "stand-up tragedian," Ferlinghetti has been called "the foremost chronicler of our times." If _A Coney Island of the Mind_ was a generation’s vibrant eye-opener, _A Far Rockaway of the Heart_ is a wake-up call for a new age.
