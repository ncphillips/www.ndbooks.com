From the appearance in 1936 of Kenneth Patchen’s first book, the voice of this great poet has been protesting war and social injustice, satirizing the demeaning and barbarous inanities of our culture––entrancing us with an inexhaustible flow of humor and fantasy. With directness and simplicity, he has restored the exultation of romantic love to its ancient bardic place beside an awareness of God’s living presence among all men. Kenneth Patchen assembled this collection in his fifty-fourth year. Since space was the only restricting factor in his choice, readers are given a direct and first-time insight into the poet’s own estimate of his concern. Additionally, the texts of many long-unavailable poems are provided.
