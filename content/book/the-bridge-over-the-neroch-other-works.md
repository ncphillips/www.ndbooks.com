Leonid Tsypkin’s novel [_Summer in Baden-Baden_](http://ndbooks.com/book/summer-in-baden-baden) was hailed as an undiscovered classic of 20th-century Russian literature. _The Washington Post_ claimed it “a chronicle of fevered genius,” and _The New York Review of Books_ described it as “gripping, mysterious and profoundly moving.” In her introduction, Susan Sontag said: “If you want from one book an experience of the depth and authority of Russian literature, read this book.” 

At long last, here are the remaining writings of Leonid Tsypkin: in the powerful novella _Bridge Over the Neroch_, the history of four generations of a Russian-Jewish family is seen through the lens of a doctor living in Moscow. In _Norartakir_, a husband and wife on vacation in Armenia bask in the view of Mt. Ararat and the ancient history of the land, until they are unceremoniously kicked out of their hotel and returned to Soviet reality. The remaining stories offer knowing windows into Soviet urban life. As the translator Jamey Gambrell says in her preface: "For Tsypkin’s narrator, history is a tightrope to be walked every minute of every day, in both his internal and external world."
