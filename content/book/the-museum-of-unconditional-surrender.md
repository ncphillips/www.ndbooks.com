After receiving glowing reviews nationwide. _The Museum of Unconditional Surrender_, by the renowned Yugoslavian writer Dubravka Ugresic, is now available as a paperback. The novel begins in the Berlin Zoo, with the contents of Roland the Walrus’s stomach displayed beside his pool. (Roland died in August, 1961.) These objects—a cigarette lighter, lollipop sticks, a beer-bottle opener, etc.—like the fictional pieces of the novel itself, are seemingly random at first, but eventually coalesce, meaningfully and poetically. Written in a variety of literary forms, _The Museum of Unconditional Surrender_ captures the shattered world of a life in exile. It addresses the themes of art and history, aging and loss, and is a haunting and extremely original novel. In the words of the (London) _Times Literary Supplement_, "it is vivid in its denunciation of destructive forces and in its evocation of what is at stake."
