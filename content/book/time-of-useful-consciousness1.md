New Directions is proud to announce a galvanizing new book by Lawrence Ferlinghetti. At ninety-three, Ferlinghetti shows more power than most any other poet at work today. He describes his new book, _Time of Useful Consciousness_ — his first since _Poetry as Insurgent Art_ — as "a fragmented recording of the American stream-of-consciousness, always westward streaming; a people’s poetic history in the tradition of William Carlos Williams’s _Paterson_, Charles Olson’s _Maximus_, Allen Ginsberg’s _Fall of America_, and Ed Sanders’s _America: A History in Verse_. ’Time of Useful Consciousness’ is an aeronautical term denoting the time between when one loses oxygen and when one passes out, the brief time in which some life-saving action is possible."
