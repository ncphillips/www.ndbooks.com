"First you take a drink," F. Scott Fitzgerald once noted, "then the drink takes a drink, then the drink takes you." Fitzgerald wrote alcohol into almost every one of his stories. _On Booze_ gathers debutantes and dandies, rowdy jazz musicians, lost children and ragtime riff-raff into a newly compiled collection taken from _The Crack-Up_, and other works never before published by New Directions. _On Booze_ portrays "The Jazz Age" as Fitzgerald experienced it: roaring, rambunctious, and lush – with quite a hangover.
