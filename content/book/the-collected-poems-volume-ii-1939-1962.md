Now available as a New Directions Paperbook, _The Collected Poems of William Carlos Williams, Volume II, 1939-1962_ (originally brought out in 1988) completes the definitive edition of Williams’ published poems (exclusive of _Paterson_) begun with _Volume I_. Edited by Christopher MacGowan of the College of William and Mary, this second volume includes the collections Williams published contemporaneously with the first four books of _Paterson_––_The Wedge_ (1944), _The Clouds_ (1948), and _The Pink Church_ (1949); the two books in which the poet developed his distinctive three-step line––_The Desert Music_ (1954) and _Journey to Love_ (1955); and his final volume, _Pictures from Brueghel_ (1962), which won a posthumous Pulitzer Prize for its author. As in _Volume I_, uncollected poems are arranged chronologically and inserted between the individual books. Extensively researched annotations provide numerous comments by the author on his poems as well as significant textual variants and helpful background information.
