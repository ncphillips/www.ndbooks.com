Slippery figures in anomalous situations – ghosts, spies, bodyguards, criminals – haunt these stories by Javier Marías: the characters come bearing their strange and special secrets, and never leave our minds. In one story, a man obsessed with his much younger lover endlessly videotapes her every move, and then confides his surprising plans for her; in another a ghost can’t stop resigning from his job. Masterfully, Marías manages in a small space to perplex and delight. "The short story fits Marías like a glove," as _Le Point_ noted. His stories have been hailed as "formidably intelligent" (_The London Review of Books_), "a bracing tonic" (_The Chicago Tribune_), and "startling" (_The New York Times Book Review_).
