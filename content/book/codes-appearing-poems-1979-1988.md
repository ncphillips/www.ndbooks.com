Michael Palmer’s _Codes Appearing_ combines in a single volume three of his most beautiful poetry volumes: _Notes for Echo Lake_, _First Figure_, and _Sun_ (1981, 1984, 1988 respectively, from North Point Press). Making available a great deal of Michael Palmer’s most influential, exciting, and stunning work, _Codes Appearing_ is a landmark volume. "It is impossible," as _The Boston Review_ noted, "to overstate Palmer’s importance." "Michael Palmer," as Joshua Clover declared in _The Village Voice_, "is the most influential avant-gardist working, and perhaps the greatest poet of his generation. And his books, including the essential ’80s triptych of _Notes for Echo Lake_, _First Figure_, and _Sun_, are organized not by story but by a dreamland of calculus and sway .... [Palmer’s] genius is for making the world strange again."
