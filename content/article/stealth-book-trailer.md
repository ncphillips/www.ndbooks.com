In _Stealth_, a novel by the Egyptian writer Sonallah Ibrahim, a young boy wanders the serpentine streets of Cairo, imbimbing its sights and sounds, and peeping into the world of the elite. To celebrate its US publication, we asked motion collage artist and poet [Nathaniel Whitcomb](http://www.nathanielwhitcomb.com/) to put together a mini-animated trailer. Inspired by vintage View Masters, Whitcomb flips through photos taken by [Don Church](http://www.coug.net/egypt/) of 1950s Cairo to let the viewer "peek in with care" to Ibrahim’s childhood world. Accompanying the animation is music by the great 20th century Egyptian singer [Umm Kulthum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umm_Kalthum_(singer)). 

_Stealth_ is now available at your local bookstore.
