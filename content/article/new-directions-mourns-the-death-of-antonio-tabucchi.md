On Sunday morning we learned that Italian author Antonio Tabucchi passed away after a battle with cancer. 

Born in Pisa in 1943 to a horse trader, Tabucchi studied literature and philosophy and before returning to Italy to begin his own writing career. Over the years he won several awards, including the Prix Médicis Etranger, the Aristeion, the Nossack, and the Europaeischer Staatspreis. Tabucchi’s books have been translated into more than forty languages and some of his novels have been adapted for the movies, directed by renowned directors like Roberto Faenza, Alain Corneau, Alain Tanner and Fernando Lopes.

While traveling in Paris, he picked up a collection of poetry by Fernando Pessoa, which initiated a lifelong love affair with Portugal. He maintained a second in Lisbon, met his future wife there, and became Pessoa’s translator into the Italian.  

He taught at the University of Siena and lectured in many prestigious  universities abroad (Bard College in New York and the Ecole de Hautes Etudes and the Collège de France in Paris). Well known as a fierce critic of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, he wrote for many Italian and foreign newspapers (_Corriere della Sera, L’Unità, Il manifesto, Le Monde, El Paìs, Diario de Noticìas, La Jornada, Die Allgemeine Zeitung_) and cultural magazines such as La Nouvelle Revue Française and Lettre International.

He will be missed, but his spirt endures.
