At the urging of New Directions President [Barbara Epler](http://ndbooks.com/about/#barbara-epler), we decided to give our cover for Vladimir Nabokov’s (amazing) novel [_The Real Life of Sebastian Knight_](http://ndbooks.com/book/the-real-life-of-sebastian-knight) a fresh coat of paint. Here’s the original design — by Rodrigo Corral — for our 2008 edition, which includes an introduction by critic Michael Dirda.

It’s beautiful. The dark silhoutte behind the thick, textured glass is absolutely perfect for the plot, and the composition lends the book the the classical status it has earned.

But here’s the new version.

One word: fuschia. We love it.
