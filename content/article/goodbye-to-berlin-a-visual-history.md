Our new stand-alone edition of Christopher Isherwood’_Goodbye to Berlin_ officially publishes tomorrow, so we thought we’d celebrate the occasion with a look at some of the covers of other editions over the years. Sally Bowles is often the focal point, and it’s hard to argue with that decision, especially when she’s rendered as well as she is in the Vintage, Signet, and Penguin Modern Classics editions. The simple hardcover edition (second row, far left) is beautiful, but stark in comparison. I have an unhealthy love of pulp novels and the sleazy covers that adorned them for several decades, so my bias is perhaps predictable, but the Signet edition is the winner to me. The reading line gives it the edge: _Bohemian Life in a Wicked City_.

Now let us cast nostalgia aside for this stunning new cover designed by Paul Sahre. The flat image here doesn’t do it justice, but the lights are actually printed with metallic inks, giving the cover a sharp glint, which seems very apt for the book. The second image below is a photo of the book as it appears on our shelves, an attempt to give you an idea of how stunning it is.

And we’d be remiss if we didn’t share these images, too: first, Isherwood’s author photo, taken, I believe, in California; and then Isherwood with Auden. Isherwood was a man who knew how to hold his head _just_ so.
