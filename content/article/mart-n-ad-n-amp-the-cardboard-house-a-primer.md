We recently published a new edition of [_The Cardboard House_](http://ndbooks.com/book/the-cardboard-house), a modernist novel written in 1928 by Peruvian poet [Martín Adán](http://ndbooks.com/author/martin-adan). Since he’s largely unknown in the English-speaking/reading world, we thought we’d offer an informal introduction. 

To begin with, however, we should offer the caveat that there really isn’t a great deal to be offered simply because, as translator [Katherine Silver](http://ndbooks.com/author/katherine-silver) points out in her preface to the book, "biographical information is sparse and anecdotal." She goes on to say:

> 
> Rafael de la Fuente was born in Lima in 1908. By the time he was a young adult, he had lost every member of his immediate family: his younger brother died who when they were children, his father, his mother, and finally the aunt and uncle under whose care he had been placed. He attended the German High School, where many of his classmates and teachers were or would become leading figures in Peru’s artistic and intellectual life of the twentieth century.
> 
> When "The Cardboard House" appeared in 1928, it was received with high critical acclaim, published within the warm embrace of a prologue by Luis Alberto Sánchez and an afterword by José Carlos Maríategui. Adán was hailed as a great innovator of Peruvian literature and the most promising young writer of his generation. For several years he moved in Lima’s literary circles and marginally participated in the political and cultural debates that raged at that time. 
> 
> Soon thereafter, the traces of his life fade into an alcoholic haze. There are anecdotes about the coffee houses he visited, the odd scrapes of napkins on which he wrote his poems, his increasing isolation, and the long periods of internment in hospitals and clinics of various kinds. He died in 1985, his final years spent shunning all public attention and only allowing visits from his editor.
> 
> "The Cardboard House" is the only prose text Martin Adán ever completed. Some six or seven volumes of poetry were published during his lifetime and this due largely to the painstaking and devoted labor of Mejía Baca, who collected the bits and pieces of paper Adán left strewn along his path. He is now considered to be one of the greatest Latin American poets of all time.

Allen Ginsberg visited Lima in the ’60s, and met with Adán in a hotel lobby, where they spent a long night talking about — what else — poetry. Ginsberg’s poem "To an Old Poet in Peru" was written shortly after, and is, though he doesn’t name Adán, about him. (You can listen to Ginsberg reading it [here](http://media.sas.upenn.edu/pennsound/authors/Ginsberg/Vancouver-Conference/Ginsberg-Allen_23_To-an-Old-Poet-in-Peru_Vancouver-Conference_07-31-63.mp3).)

> Because we met at dusk
> Under the shadow of the railroad station
>                                      clock
> While my shade was visiting Lima
> And your ghost was dying in Lima
>             old face needing a shave
> And my young beard sprouted
>             magnificent as the dead hair
>                          in the sands of Chancay
> Because I mistakenly thought you were
>                                 melancholy
> Saluting your 60 year old feet
>             which smell of the death
>                         of spiders on the pavement
> And you saluted my eyes
>                  with your anisetto voice
> Mistakenly thinking I was genial
>                                     for a youth
> (my rock and roll is the motion of an
>                         angel flying in a modern city)
> (your obscure shuffle is the motion
>                           of a seraphim that has lost
>                                  its wings)
> I kiss you on your fat cheek (once more tomorrow
> Under the stupendous Desamparados clock)
> Before I go to my death in an airplane crash
>                         in North America (long ago)
> And you go to your heart-attack on an indifferent
>                         street in South America
> (Both surrounded by screaming
>             communists with flowers
>                         in their ass)
> —you much sooner than I—
>             or on a long night alone in a room
>             in the old hotel of the world
>                         watching a black door
>             . . . surrounded by scraps of paper

What we do have, however, is _The Cardboard House_, which Silver suggests is _the_ notebook that houses his life’s words. Of the book, a series of fragmented scenes composed as the narrator travels around Barranco, a a seaside town on the outskirts of Lima, she says:

> Each fragment, and even each image within each fragment, is a world unto itself, vibrating through Adán’s power of evocation. Most critics have given up looking for any thematic or narrative development, and only the narrator and Ramón — his friend, alter ego, and rival — could possibly qualify as characters Adán borrows — from Proust, from Joyce, from Góngora — but he laughs at himself for doing so, as he laughs at his nation for that native and premature desire that Europe will make of us men. He makes no bones about who he is: a provincial boy in a semicolonial world who experiences the modern world as it is exported to him.

As mentioned above, this is a new edition. Graywolf published Silvers’s original translation in 1990, and for this edition she has gone back to make "significant though not extensive changes." Of this re-reading and re-translating, she says:

> Coming back to this text twenty years later, I find this small, unique gem from the seacoast of the south shimmering even more brightly, but I now perceive more fully the swirls of darkness that would so overwhelm the poet’s life.

The praise may seem a bit biased coming from the translator, but _Publishers Weekly_, who [reviewed](http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-55597-129-8) the book back in 1990, said that if you are willing to accept the fragmented style, you "will probably enjoy the richness of Adan’s imagery and the musicality of his language."
