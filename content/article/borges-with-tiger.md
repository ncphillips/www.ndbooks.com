Simply because it exists, we ordered up a copy of an out-of-print book called [_Atlas_](http://www.amazon.com/Atlas-Jorge-Luis-Borges/dp/0525243445/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1354296856&sr=8-1&keywords=borges+atlas), published in 1985 and gathering images of Jorge Luis Borges in various locations around the world, along with his thoughts on these places. The production quality, to be frank, is rather poor, but it’s still a joy to look at pictures of Borges getting in a hot air balloon in California, sitting in front of gigantic statues in Geneva (where he’s [buried](http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/the-tombstone-of-argentinian-writer-jorge-luis-borges-in-news-photo/84737062)), staring up at a minaret in Istanbul, or sitting on a bench in the [Labyrinth](http://ndbooks.com/book/labyrinths) in Crete.

But for my money the best picture is Borges with a tiger, at an unidentified zoo:

The text accompanying this image begins:

> There have always been tigers in my life. Reading has been so interwoven with all the other habits of my days that I really don’t know if my first tiger was the one in a book engraving, or that other one, long dead, whose stubborn coming and going around the cage I watched in fascination from the opposite side of the iron bars. My father was fond of encyclopedias; I judged them, I’m sure, according to their pictures of tigers.

This image immediately made me think of this cover for a University of Texas edition of Borges’s _el Hacedor_, published in English as _Dreamtigers_, using the title of one of the short book’s prose pieces. The cover is a woodcut by Uruguayan artist Antonio Frasconi, and he perfectly captures Borges’s closing lines:

> Oh, incompetence! Never can my dreams engender the wild beast I long for. The tiger indeed appears, but stuffed or flimsy, or with impure variations of shape, or of an implausible size, or all too fleeting, or with a touch of the dog or the bird.

And just for fun, a picture of Borges with a cat.
