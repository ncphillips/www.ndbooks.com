Writing of Xi Chuan’s first book length collection of poems in English, _Notes on the Mosquito_, [Bookslut](http://www.bookslut.com/features/2012_11_019582.php) states that, "What unites [Chuan’s] lyric poems and his essay-poems is that they all carry a sense of the world’s plentitude and of the world’s puzzlement. The plentitude itself is bewildering and the bewilderment has a certain beauty."
