![IMG_3313.JPG](http://ndbooks.com/images/uploads/IMG_3313.JPG)Eliot Weinberger and Lydia Davis read last night to a crowded audience in a dimly-lit KGB Bar for its "True Story Non-Fiction" series. Weinberger and Davis, having known eachother since highschool, exchanged humorous comments about who was the "cooler kid" back in the day before settling ito read. Coincidentally, both authors had a similar trajectory to their readings: three or four short new pieces followed by a much longer "poem essay." Whether this had been planned in advance by the two old friends, whose to say? But in style and interest, both writers carved their own niches. Ms. Davis focused on everyday encounters and people portraits, and her poem essay described a village in pilgrim America. Mr. Weinberger weaved stories such as a small Indian village’s wedding rituals into almost Aesopian fables. His poem essay was a tribute to the lost birds of paradise. There was a rhythm to the readings that lent an air of enchantment to the evening keeping the audience hushed and attentive. You can watch Eliot Weinberger reading from a new piece above.

Back on September 17, [Community Bookstore](http://communitybookstore.net/) in Brooklyn celebrated their 40th anniversary with a reading at the Old First Reformed Church. I’m told 900 people were in attendance, and judging by the pictures [here](http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/34/38/dtg_bb_bookstore_2011_9_23_bp.html), I’m inclined to believe them. I was there, sitting near a column, my view of the stage almost entirely blocked, but I could see the podium. The presenters were asked to read from their favorite book of the last forty years, and although event coordinator Stephanie Valdez managed to keep their selections under wraps until the day of the reading, she did tip me off to the fact that both Paul Auster and Siri Hustvedt (who live nearby and are frequent customers) would be reading from New Directions books!

First, Mr. Auster read from George Oppen’s _[New Collected Poems](http://ndbooks.com/book/new-collected-poems)_ after providing a beautiful biography of Oppen’s fascinating life. Ms. Hustvedt was later in the program, and she read from Bollinger Prize winner (and [Blaney lecturer](http://ndbooks.com/blog/notices/susan-howes-blaney-lecture-on-poetry-telepathy-this-friday)) Susan Howe’s book [_My Emily Dickinson_.](http://ndbooks.com/book/my-emily-dickinson) Alas, as far as I know there isn’t any video footage, so you’ll have to trust me when I say that any time you can see them read and talk about poetry, jump at the chance.

I can, however, share the following with you. These are Ms. Hustvedt’s introductory remarks about Susan Howe and her book, reproduced from the notes she gave me after the event:

*  *  *

_My Emily Dickinson_ is a critical, scholarly, poetic, subversive, mordant, brilliant book written by the poet Susan Howe. It is by far the best work about our greatest poet I have ever read, and I have read many.

It is not easy to read from this book, as Howe’s sentences are sometimes dense. She plays with the poet’s play. Dickinson’s poems come and go unannounced. Howe is so deeply immersed in Dickinson’s language and in the multiple sources of that inimitable language that the reader must be attuned to Howe’s particular kind of erudition, a form of knowing that refuses to bow to the conventions of literary criticism, but more importantly, she resists the very idea of binary oppositions, hot and cold, high and low, man and woman. Meanings are not fixed. They slide.

The book’s epigraph is from William Carlos Williams’s _In the American Grain_, a work that foreshadows_ My Emily Dickinson._

I will read the epigraph, Howe’s first sentence, and then part of a section called "Identity and Memory." I would like to stress that Howe’s insights about the lot of a woman writing are relevant _now_. The cheap platitudes and truisms of our culture, which proclaim that although women writers may once have suffered from condescension by the patriarchal powers-that-be, they no longer do, is utter bunk. Things have changed, and they have stayed the same.

*  *  *

The epigraph, in case you’re curious:

> It is the women above all — there never have been women, save pioneer Katies; not one in flower save some moonflower Poe may have seen, or an unripe child. Poets? Where? They are the test. But a true woman in flowe, never. Emily Dickinson, starving of passion in her father’s garden, is the very nearesy we have ever been — starving.
> 
> Never a woman: never a poet. That’s an axiom. Never a poet saw sun here.

(William Carlos Williams, [In the American Grain)](http://ndbooks.com/book/in-the-american-grain)

And Howe’s first sentence:

> My book is a contradiction of its epigraph.
