> "Day in day out, when the inarticulate patient struggles to lay himself bare for you, or with nothing more than a boil on his back, is so caught off balance that he reveals some secret twist of a whole community’s pathetic way of thought, a man is suddenly seized again with a desire to speak of the undergound stream which for a moment has come up just under the surface….
