Announcing the ND poetry and prose subscription!

We are pleased to announce, after a fifty-year hiatus, the return of the ND subscription. By subscribing, our poetry Pamphlet series and/or our prose Pearl series will arrive at your door on a monthly basis.

We are offering three different subscription choices.

For $75 you can choose either of the following:

The ND poetry subscription: Twelve new and recent ND Pamphlets
The ND prose subscription: Twelve new and recent ND Pearls

And for $125 we are offering a deluxe subscription:

Both ND Pearl and Pamphlet subscriptions, a box of our Alvin Lustig ND cover postcards, a tote bag, and a special gift from us that will come at the end of your subscription.

These offers are currently available at our [online shop](http://ndbooks.com/shop/goods/). We look forward to your subscription!
