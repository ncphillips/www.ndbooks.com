In their review of _The Miracle Cures of Dr. Aira,_ _[Flying Object ](http://www.flying-object.org/?p=5114)_concludes that Aira, "is fascinated by possibilities, no matter how fantastic, or banal, or minute. He is rendered vertiginous by the potentiality of the Universie, and his ability to write that down, to cause change, to create an instance, to fill a moment with some sort of happening or occurence. He wonders what is around every corner."
