Last night I put on my favorite suit and made the trek to midtown to the Permanent Cuban Mission to the United Nations — housed in a spacious, if slightly rundown, building on Lexington Avenue a few blocks from the U.N. headquarters — to celebrate the publication of the new book _[Who Killed Che?](http://www.orbooks.com/our-books/who-killed-che/)_ Mojitos were served, pictures were taken, and Ricardo Alarcón, President of the Cuban National Assembly, spoke to the large crowd via telephone. During one of many conversations about Occupy Wall Street, someone mentioned Che’s famous U.N. speech, which made me think of this picture:
