On a bright autumn day, some of us folks from New Directions took a trip to Sterling Pierce in Far Rockaway, the facility where our galleys and some other materials are printed. They showed us their magic printing machines, giant rolls of paper, and galley trimming guillotines. After our tour, the ever charming owner of Sterling Pierce, Bill Burke, took us on a ride on his boat aptly named Hot off the Press.

Thanks to Sterling Pierce for the tour and keeping our galleys looking fresh!
