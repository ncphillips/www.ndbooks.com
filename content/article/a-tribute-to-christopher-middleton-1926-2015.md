New Directions mourns the loss of our friend, the wonderful poet and translator, Christopher Middleton.

"He is an incomparable stylist, a wry ironist, a philosopher of words. The only category in which he fits justly is that of poet."—Guy Davenport

We share the sorrow of his family, friends, readers, and admirers—and we take solace in the beautiful work he has left for us.
