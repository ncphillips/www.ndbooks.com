Congratulations to Hungarian author Lászlo Krasznahorkai and translator Ottilie Mulzet!

On Monday, April 28, Krasznahorkai’s novel [_Seiobo There Below_](http://ndbooks.com/book/seiobo-there-below) — translated into English by Mulzet — was announced as the winner of the 2014 Best Translated Book Award for Fiction. This is Krasznahorkai’s second consecutive BTBA, after _Satantango_ took the 2013 honor. 

Krasznahorkai happened to stop by the New Directions offices that same afternoon, so we took advantage and recorded him "accepting" the prize. Enjoy!
