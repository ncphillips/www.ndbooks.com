Happy Poetry Month! 

We’re a day late starting the festivities, but to make up for the delay we’ve got an excerpt from [Susan Howe](http://ndbooks.com/author/susan-howe)’s [_Sorting Facts, or 19 Ways of Looking at Marker_](http://ndbooks.com/book/sorting-facts-or-nineteen-ways-of-looking-at-marker), part of the (new) New Directions [Poetry Pamphlets](http://ndbooks.com/book/poetry-pamphlets) series, the first four of which we published in March. The book is essentially what the title suggests: the poet’s powerful mediation on the filmmaker’s work.

> **VII**

> "In the middle of this warm prewar Sunday, where he could now stay."
> 
> — Chris Marker, ’La Jetée’

> Yesterday words could come between the distance. Frame light, for example. All living draw near. Knowing no data no something then something. No never and no opposite occident orient. Film with jumps and quick cuts. Dissolves and slide effects. Real chalk. Burnt-out ruins. Without weariness. Without our working conditions. When our forces hadn’t been thrown.

> What is valid documentary? In the long struggle who transmits the Diaspora?

> Kolya, the future Ivan, David, my future husband, pick up the receiver. Real children on a peacetime morning before ruin. No sequence of dust fire smoldering ash. Just back to morning. The June of Everything.

> Where in the flame does a film stop time?
