As a teenager in the early 1960s, I wrote a short story called “But Not for Me," inspired by and written while listening to Ahmad Jamal's album _Live at the Pershing: But Not for Me_. It wasn't a very good story but it launched a pattern in which music would repeatedly impact, appear in and be referred to in my writing, whether poetry or prose. The examples are so numerous and so obvious as to all but go without needing mention, beginning with my first chapbook, dedicated to John Coltrane, taking its title from Archie Shepp's album _Four for Trane_ and extending to particular musicians and pieces of music being said to be “on the box" in my ongoing serial poems _Song of the Andoumboulou_ and _“Mu,"_ each of which takes its title from a piece of recorded music. The instances or examples are nowhere more numerous or more obvious than in my ongoing epistolary fiction _From a Broken Bottle Traces of Perfume Still Emanate_, comprised of letters written by composer/multi-instrumentalist N., founding member of the band Molimo m'Atet, formerly known as the Mystic Horn Society, the East Bay Dread Ensemble and the Deconstructive Woodwind Chorus. N. frequently refers to recorded music that inspires and instructs him and the other members of the band.

In 2010, when New Directions reissued the first three volumes, _Bedouin Hornbook_, _Djbot Baghostus's Run_ and _Atet A.D_., as _From a Broken Bottle Traces of Perfume Still Emanate: Volumes 1-3_, my editor Jeffrey Yang suggested compiling and including a discography of these references, which I did. Michael Barron recently suggested doing the same for volume four in the series, _Bass Cathedral_. That discography follows, along with a 90-minute music mix that I programmed, comprised of eighteen tracks that appear on it. The latter samples not only the discography, _Bass Cathedral_'s soundscape, but my former life as a radio disc jockey, beginning as an undergraduate at Princeton University's WPRB and including nearly thirty years at Santa Cruz's KUSP. I've said before and I'll end by saying again that I've long felt similarities between the processes of selection, sequencing, juxtaposition, pacing, transition, etc. that putting a radio program together entails and those involved in writing prose, writing poetry and editing my journal _Hambone_. —NM
