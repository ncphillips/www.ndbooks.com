In this personal account, Anderson Tepper, writing for _Tin House_, reflects on reading Clarie Lispector, stating that, "No book, no voice, vibrated more with me than Clarice Lispector’s _Near to the Wild Heart_.  I was nearer to the wild heart than ever, and this small, iridescent book was a revelation."
