Join [Peter Cole](http://ndbooks.com/author/peter-cole), "one of the handful of authentic poets of his own American generation" (Harold Bloom), for a reading from his fourth collection of poetry [_The Invention of Influence_](http://ndbooks.com/book/the-invention-of-influence). With Ben Lerner, Cole will discuss how his work as a poet and translator of modern and medieval Hebrew and Arabic relate, the concept of the "influence machine" at the heart of the book, and how he manages a poetry as aesthetically rich as it is intellectually rigorous. As [Ben Lerner](http://coffeehousepress.org/authors/ben-lerner/) writes: "Religious, erotic, elegiac, pissed offâ€”the affective range is wide and the forms restless."
