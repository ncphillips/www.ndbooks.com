[Join Boston University for a reading](http://www.bu.edu/calendar/?uid=152001%4017.calendar.bu.edu) and conversation with [Jenny Erpenbeck](http://ndbooks.com/author/jenny-erpenbeck). One of Germany’s rising literary stars, Erpenbeck was born in East Berlin in 1967. Her grandfather, grandmother, and father were all published writers in a variety of genres, while her mother was a translator. She has worked on opera and musical productions in Berlin and Graz since 1991, and is now a freelance writer and producer living near Graz. Erpenbeck’s fiction includes the much-lauded novel [_The Old Child_ ](http://ndbooks.com/book/the-old-child-other-tales)and the short story collection [_The Book of Words_](http://ndbooks.com/book/book-of-words). Most recently she has published the wonderfully evocative novel [_Visitation_](http://ndbooks.com/book/visitation). Erpenbeck’s often surreal and always enigmatic fiction has now been translated into 14 languages.The event will be moderated by Erpenbeck’s English-language translator, [Susan Bernofsky](http://ndbooks.com/author/susan-bernofsky), an expert on German literature and culture as well as on the theory and practice of literary translation. Bernofsky teaches literary translation in the MFA Writing Program at the Columbia University School of the Arts and blogs about literary translation at [www.translationista.org](http://www.translationista.org).
