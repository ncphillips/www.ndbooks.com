In the January 1 issue of the_New York Times Magazine_, critic at large Sam Anderson opens his books and shares some marginal scribblings. Below is the printed version, and over on their [website](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/01/01/magazine/sam-anderson-marginalia.html?ref=magazine) is a fancy multi-media version wherein Anderson talks about each note, including a defense/explanation of his "LOL" note in reference to a poem by Anne Carson. (It turns out he requires himself to actually laugh out loud and not just smile.)

Once I stopped smiling about the fact that three of the twelve selections were from New Directions titles (_[Birds, Beasts and Seas](http://ndbooks.com/book/birds-beasts-and-seas)_; [_Between Parentheses_](http://ndbooks.com/book/between-parentheses-essays-articles-and-speeches-1998-2003); and _[Lightning Rods](http://ndbooks.com/book/lightning-rods)_), I started wondering why I stopped writing in the margins of the books I read. Before I get to any philosophical reasons there exists one rather practical reason: reading on the subway generally (unless you’re somehow lucky or sly enough to nab a seat) means holding a book with one hand and holding a pole with another, making the act of scribbling on anything just about impossible.

But that is not my reason. I think I stopped (and there was a time, certainly, when I scribbled and underlined extensively; the copy of _Mrs. Dalloway_ that I read when I was twenty-two is covered in blue ink) when I began to realize that my tastes were changing over time, a fact that led me to foresee opening a book twenty years later only to be horrified by what I had to say about Susan Sontag as a naive young man. Perhaps I lack conviction in my tastes and opinions? 

Lest I venture off on a personal and perhaps existential tangent, let me end by saying that Anderson’s act of sharing — and annotating, to make it sort of meta — his marginalia is a fascinating and thought-provoking little spread that I for one appreciated on my hungover New Year’s Day.
