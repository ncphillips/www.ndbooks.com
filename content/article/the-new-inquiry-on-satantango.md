Reviewer Ben Bevacqua revels in Krasznahorkai’s [masterpiece](http://ndbooks.com/book/satantango), saying that "Krasznahorkai’s mastery of structure, character, and language is matched by his ability to simultaneously weave all three together; readers can feel themselves physiologically immersed in the world of the book, itself a finely orchestrated system."
