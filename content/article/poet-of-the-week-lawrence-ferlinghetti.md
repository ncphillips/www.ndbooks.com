_Due to popular demand, and as a concession to common sense, we’ve decided to put poems here on our website — one poet per week._

[Lawrence Ferlinghetti](http://ndbooks.com/author/lawrence-ferlinghetti): poet, novelist, publisher, bookseller, social activist, and much more. An enduring American icon at a time when achieving such status seems impossible. 

The December 19 issue of _The Nation_ features a new poem by Ferlinghetti, one that addresses Occupy Wall Street and its attendant issues. We’ve posted it below, but you should still head over to _The Nation_’s site afterwards to hear a [recording](http://www.thenation.com/audio/164827/lawrence-ferlinghetti-reads-first-and-last-everything) of him reading it at Club Fugazi. 

> "The First and the Last of Everything"
> 
> The first fine dawn of life on earth
> The first cry of Man in the first light
> The first firefly flickering at night
> The first Noble Savage with the first erection
> The first song of love and forty cries of despair
> The first voyage of Vikings westward
> The first sighting of the New World
>                    from the crow’s nest of a Spanish galleon
> The first Pale Face meeting the first Native American
> The first Dutch trader in Mannahatta
> The first settler on the first frontier
> The first Home Sweet Home so dear
> The first wagon train westward
> The first sighting of the Pacific by Lewis & Clark
> The first cry of “Mark, twain!” on the Mississippi
> The first desegregation by Huck & Jim on a raft at night
> The first buffalo-head nickel and the last buffalo
> The first barbed-wire fence and the last of the open range
> The last cowboy on the last frontier
> The first skyscraper in America
> The first home run hit at Yankee Stadium
> The first ballpark hot dog with mustard
> The last War to End All Wars
> The last Wobbly and the last Catholic Anarchist
> The last living member of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade
> The last bohemian in a beret
> The last homespun politician and the first stolen election
> The first plane to hit the first Twin Tower
> The birth of a vast national paranoia
> The first president to become an international criminal
>                for crimes against humanity making America a terrorist state
> The dark dawn of American corporate fascism
> The next-to-last free speech radio
> The next-to-last independent newspaper raising hell
> The next-to-last independent bookstore with a mind of its own
> The next-to-last Lefty looking for Obama Nirvana
> The first fine day of the Wall Street Occupation
>                to set forth upon this continent a new nation!

And as an unabashed fanboy of Lawrence Ferlinghetti (I am still awed when I get emails from him), I can’t resist sharing my two favorite poems from the modern classic, [_A Coney Island of the Mind_](http://ndbooks.com/book/a-coney-island-of-the-mind1), first published by New Directions in 1958. 

> "9"
> 
> See
>        it was like this when
>                                we waltz into this place
> a couple of far out cats
>                                  is doing an Aztec two-step
> And I says
>                 Dad let’s cut
> but then this dame
>                          comes up behind me see
>                                              and says
>                              You and me could really exist
> Wow I says
>                    Only the next day
>                           she has bad teeth
>                                      and really hates
>                                                               poetry

I love the snapshot glimpse of an era, and the slang, and the guiltless vanity at the end.

> "26"
> 
> That ‘sensual phosphorescence
>                                                   my youth delighted in’
> 
> now lies almost behind me
>                                         like a land of dreams
>            wherein an angel
>                                      of hot sleep
>        dances like a diva
>                                 in strange veils
>             thru which desire
>                                      looks and cries
> 
> And still she dances
>                               dances still
>      and still she comes
>                                     at me
>                                            with breathing breasts
>            and secret lips
> 
>                                   and (ah)  
> 
>                                              bright eyes

That _(ah)_ is just perfect. Masterful.
