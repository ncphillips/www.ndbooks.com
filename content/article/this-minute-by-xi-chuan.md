_This Minute_

this minute, a man carries a coffin down the street
his buttons are open, he's sweaty all over
his feet tap the street splashed with starlight
he sees the death-dark roofs and red-skinned lamps from his dreams
we live together on this planet of deserts and seas

this minute, the wind advances on the roadless ocean and desert
who moves all the trash? who turns a flashlight to the sky?
who grabs onto the bird that comes flying
and discards a handful of iron filings?
we live together on this planet of deserts and seas

five hundred women in five hundred rooms loosen their braids
remove shoes and socks, and come to the window in shorts
five hundred managers turn off the lights in five hundred libraries
listening to the rumbling and grumbling of their stomachs
we live together on this planet of deserts and seas

five continents, seven seas, the prime meridian crosses the equator
crossbreeding donkeys with horses bears mules
the gingko tree is divided by sex like humans
scientists train chimpanzees to count one to ten
we live together on this planet of deserts and seas

this minute, a man is becoming Picasso
another is becoming Chairman Mao
the fathers of the world master adversities, while the young
demand they deny their life's struggles
we live together on this planet of deserts and seas

piles of leaves have been incinerated. Autumn, always autumn
those who throw themselves into flames leave all sorts of questions
when the majority have stepped from autumn into winter
some old lady will still be wearing a flower in her hair
we live together on this planet of deserts and seas

a gaunt man takes to the road, sitting between
two salespeople on the hard seats of a train
no one knows who he is, watching him munch sunflower seeds
staring at the towns skimming past his window
we live together on this planet of deserts and seas

this minute, a boy sticks his foot out from under a blanket
his doting grandmother hurries to tuck it in
such a little guy should be flying over the street
bearing all the ardor and wisdom of life
we live together on this planet of deserts and seas
