_Due to popular demand, and as a concession to common sense, we’ve decided to put poems here on our website — one poet per week._

This week, we present Forrest Gander. Following in the footsteps of many New Directions poets, Forrest is a Renaissance man with degrees in geology _and_ literature. He’s written novels, poetry, and criticism, and has translated, as well. His most recent collection, [_Core Samples from the World_](http://ndbooks.com/book/core-samples-from-the-world), has been [named](http://bookcritics.org/blog/archive/press-release-draft) a finalist for the 2012 NBCC Award in Poetry. 

The collection is a collaboration with three photographers that travels the globe exploring the tension between the foreign and the familiar, and what emerges is an empathetic portrait of the world’s fundamental nature. To give you an idea of the unique structure Gander has created for the mixture of poetry and short essays, as well as the scope of landscapes, here’s the table of contents:

**One:**
Evaporation
A Clearing _With photos by Raymond Meeks_
Xinjiang: The Pamirs Poetry Journey

**Evaporation 2**

> In increments enunciated (Oh) within
>              where the meanings (in increments) lie
> bare (she says) (Oh, to her friend)
> 
>              who is watching (I am watching) a cat slink
> (while we walk) keeping pace with us
>              through the fenestrated walls (adobe) of
> 
> a ruined house (Oh, this finger) in the village
>              where she grew up (her accent
> makes clear) This finger, she says,
> 
>              delighted, holding it up,
> has a heart in it! (Pulse)
>              And thinking I don’t see (the friend), she
> 
> takes (from her purse) a toothpaste tube
>              (purse open) as she walks (we walk)
> (where’s the cat?) along the soft
> 
>              path between (adobe) walls,
> squeezes toothpaste
>              on her finger (with its heart) and smears
> 
> it (looking away) against her upper
>              and (still looking away) lower teeth
> then touches me (with her breath)

_from _**"The Tinajera Notebook"**

> So the present
> hoses itself out. And with it—
> 
> Sitting in the lobby of the clinic,
> its walls painted
> like children’s rooms with starfish
> 
> and trains and jungle birds
> and the children shuttling back and forth, the nurse
> calling their name and a few words
> 
> in English or Spanish, the children
> taking their mother’s
> or father’s hand,
> 
> trailing the nurse past
> a registration desk, down
> the hall, the sequence of closed doors,
> 
> toward the one door open. Radiance inside. Bald
> children wearing hats, and a bald baby in a mother’s arms, and
> here in the lobby, where I wait for you
> 
> to be X-rayed,
> some stranger whose exhaustion
> can’t be fathomed, begins to snore. If this
> 
> is the world and its time, as irrevocably it is,
> when I step out into sunlit air
> suffused with sausage smoke and bus exhaust,
> 
> with its relentless ads
> for liquor and underwear,
> where am I then?

_from _**"Lovegreen"**

>                              That the trunk, submerged in air,
> whirling leaves, thresholds-out. On the bark of
>                                                         its leader stem, a black-capped
>                               chickadee pins caterpillars and lacewings.
>            Its water-sprouts and spurs unpruned,
>                                        unbraced, the Yellow Transparent tree’s
> boughs release the girl open-mouthed
>                                              pumping her two-wheeler
>                                                          across a meadow softly-furred
>                               as a bumble bee, her plastic bag
>               pendant with hard apples
>                                                                             from one handlebar swaying—

>                                      Coffee cut with honeysuckle.
>                          The unprimed pump won’t give up its water.
>                       Mosquito hawk clings to the barn wall’s shadow.
