Just before the AIGA’s "[The Lustigs: A Cover Story](http://www.aiga.org/the-lustigs-exhibition/)" exhibition closed in February, the entire New Directions staff made the short walk to Broadway and spent some time marveling in the collected, properly displayed beauty of his work. There were, of course, lots of New Directions books on the walls, along with many other books from other (smart) publishers. But also included were some magazine and brochure covers that not too many of us even knew he’d done. So, without further ado, on to the pictures.

Lastly, what the placard said was Lustig’s first paying design job,
a motoring enthusiast publication, it seems, from 1933.
