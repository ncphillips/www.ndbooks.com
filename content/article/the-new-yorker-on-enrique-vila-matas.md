Joanna Kavenna writes of Enrique Vila-Matas: "By lifting the heavy weight of the past, by setting irony against dogmatism and rigidity, Vila-Matas allows his characters, and us, to contemplate the future." Read an excerpt over at [_The New Yorker_](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2012/09/03/120903crbo_books_kavenna).
