_Gawker_’s Nitasha Tiku recently wrote a [piece](http://gawker.com/was-pablo-neruda-murdered-by-a-cia-double-agent-working-511011666) about Pablo Neruda’s body being exhumed to (hopefully, finally) determine if he died of prostate cancer — as was reported at the time of his death, a mere twelve days after the CIA-backed coup that put Pinochet in power — or if, as many people have claimed over the years, he was murdered. The investigation into Neruda’s death is part of a much larger one into hundreds of human rights atrocities carried out by Pinochet and his followers over the years.

It’s a sad and infuriating story, for a lot of reasons, and it’s been weighing on my mind since I read it a few days ago. So to change my mood, and to remind people _why_ Pablo Neruda was so revered (astonishing fact: after delivering his Nobel acceptance speech in Stockholm, he returned to Santiago and read before a crowd of 70,000 people!), I looked back through our archives of New Directions Readers, the annuals that James Laughlin published for many years alongside the books. Neruda appears in _New Directions 8_, and though are too many to reproduce here, I did scan a few, along with the cover and flap copy, to present them as they were published, rather than re-typing anything. I hope you enjoy.
