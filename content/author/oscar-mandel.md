Born in Antwerp, Belgium in 1926, Oscar Mandel fled with his family from the Germans in 1940 and settled in the United States. He has lived in New York, Philadelphia, Columbus, Ohio (where he received his PhD from Ohio State University in 1951), Lincoln, Nebraska, Los Angeles, and presently lives in Pasadena, California. He is Professor of Humanities and Social Sciences at California Institute of Technology, and the author and translator of twenty books of poetry, criticism, fiction and drama. His many articles have appeared in such reviews as Virginia Quarterly, Antioch Review, Columbia University, Forum South Atlantic Quarterly, American Scholar, Accent, and The Massachusetts Review. Handelâ€™s dramatic works have been produced, since 1961, on radio and in theaters in the United States, France, Switzerland and at the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh.
