The only writer to ever be nominated for a National Book Award in Fiction for both a first and second novel, Rachel Kushner is clearly an author to watch. Kushner began her Bachelor’s in Political Economy at the University of California, Berkeley when she was only sixteen and went on to obtain an MFA in Creative Writing from Columbia University. She published her first novel, _Telex from Cuba_, in 2008. Kushner has edited for _Grand Street Magazine_, _BOMB_, _Soft Targets_, and _Artforum_, among others. Her fiction and essays can be found in the _New Yorker_, the _New York Times_, and the _Paris Review_, and frequently focus on issues of feminism, contemporary art, revolutionary politics, culture, and modernism. In 2013 _New York Magazine_ called Kushner’s second book, _The Flamethrowers_, “probably the most heatedly discussed book of the year.” For this title Kushner was a finalist for the 2014 Folio Prize, the James Tate Black Prize, and the Bailey’s Prize. She was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship in 2013 as well as an honorary PhD from Kalamazoo College. She lives in Los Angeles with her husband and son.
