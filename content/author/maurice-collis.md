Maurice Collis (1889-1975) was born in Dublin, graduated from Oxford, and joined the Indian Civil Service in Burma in 1912. While serving in Rangoon, Maurice Collis fell into official disfavor for fraternizing with the Burmese and Chinese residents, and was posted to the obscure port of Mergui. After his retirement in 1936, he wrote at least twenty historical books.
