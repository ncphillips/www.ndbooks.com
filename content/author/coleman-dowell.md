Coleman Dowell (1925-1985) was born and raised in Kentucky. After serving in the US Army Medical Corps during World War II, Dowell found his way to New York, where he worked as a typist, model and songwriter for Broadway musicals and television. After becoming disillusioned with the theater, Dowell turned to fiction and received the admiration and praise of writers like John Hawkes, Gilbert Sorrentino and Tennessee Williams.
