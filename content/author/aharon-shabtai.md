An Israeli poet born in 1939, Shabtai is notorious for his poems of frank erotic confessionalism and political rage, which appear regularly in the leading newspaper, _Ha’aretz_. On another side, he is the primary translator of classical Greek literature into Hebrew. New Directions published his book, _J’Accuse_, in 2003 and _War & Love: Love & War: New and Selected Poems_ in 2010, both translated by Peter Cole. Also available in English is _Love & Selected Poems _(Sheep Meadow, 1997).
